I have the greatest job in the world, where I get to spend all my time learning, discussing, studying, and thinking about the future of knowledge work, how AI impacts that, and what it means for Citrix and our extended community. I finished the year with 26 essays & posts, 4 keynote talks posted to YouTube, and several podcast guest appearances. I've cataloged and arranged everything here for my (and your) easy reference.

## The big ideas (my 3 most important essays of 2025)

I'll start with the three most important essays which set the foundation for my core thesis about how AI will truly impact knowledge work:

- AI will be THE interface to knowledge work. Here's how we'll get there. (Dec 2025)
- The 7-stage roadmap for human-AI collaboration in the workplace (June 2025)
- Everyone's wrong about why enterprise AI is failing (Aug 2025)

## The post-application era

- AI just created 10,000 accidental citizen developers. Welcome to the post-application era! (Oct 2025)
- Will AI need to operate your legacy desktop apps, or is direct file manipulation enough? (Oct 2025)

## Worker-led AI & shadow strategy

- Workers don't want to build automations. They want to delegate. (Dec 2025)
- Worker-led AI isn't shadow IT. It's shadow strategy. (Sept 2025)
- The bitter lesson of workplace AI: Stop engineering, start enabling (Sept 2025)
- IT admits workers control AI. Workers admit they use it to leave at 5. (Dec 2025)

## AI agents & security

- AI agents are the new insider threat. Secure them like human workers. (Aug 2025)
- Why AI agents will use the same desktops and apps as human workers (July 2025)
- What happens when AI agents score 100% in computing using benchmarks? (July 2025)

## Boring infrastructure beats moonshots

- If AI is normal technology, boring infrastructure is your best strategy (Sept 2025)
- If AI progress stopped today, we can still transform the enterprise (Aug 2025)
- Forget the model wars. The real AI race is in the workplace. (June 2025)
- Everyone wants to provide your AI. Nobody wants to help you manage it. (Nov 2025)

## For leaders & CEOs

- Making sense of AI in the workplace: A starting point for leaders (Apr 2025)
- Your CEO just sent a company-wide "AI-First" memo. Now what? (May 2025)
- What if your CEO never sends the AI-first memo? (May 2025)

## Historical perspective

## You can track all this via bmad.com

Finally, I have a personal website at bmad.com, which is a simple static site which lists all this on the homepage, as well as has links to other podcasts and resources I like. (No actual content lives on bmad, it's just links to my stuff elsewhere.)
