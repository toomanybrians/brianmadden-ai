# EUC World Independence 2024: A huge success!

*Brian Madden—October 2024*

I'm on the plane leaving Washington DC, where I just attended the inaugural 2-day conference called EUC World: Independence, a brand-new, independent, community-driven technical conference focusing on EUC (end user computing: Windows desktops, future of the workplace, etc.).

For the first time in almost ten years, I felt a vibe and energy similar to what we had at BriForum all those years. I was honored to have the opportunity to give the opening keynote (in the same theater, and in fact on the same exact stage where I delivered the first BriForum keynote nearly 20 years ago!)

In my talk, I spoke about the past, present, and future of EUC, with a focus on how the desktop will be front-and-center of our world in the next few years as we look for a secure, compliant, and safe space to deploy AI agents which do work on behalf of employees.

My keynote was not officially recorded, however Alex Danilychev, Ph.D. recorded the whole thing via his phone from his seat in the audience. It's on YouTube here. (Thanks Alex!)

The whole EUC World: Independence event was fantastic. It really had the "community" vibe, in a "we're all in this together, let's help each other" kind of way. Great people. Great sessions. Caring and passionate sponsors and attendees. Really, really well done. The only negative feedback I heard was, "I wish this event lasted one more day."

EUC World: Independence was produced by the nonprofit World of EUC community organization, which I highly recommend joining. (It's free.) They have a Slack community, blogs, podcasts, and lots of other free community technical content.

Congrats to the World of EUC board of directors: Jarian Gibson, Sean Massey, Patrick Coble, Stephen Wagner & Janna White, with huge props to event manager Jennifer H. Gibbons.

I will be the first to sign up for next year's event!

*Program Note: If you're in Europe, I will be giving a similar talk at the EUC Forum's winter meeting in London on November 26th.*
