# I built a second brain using AI, and it's changed the way I work. THIS is the future of knowledge work.

*Brian Madden—February 2026*
*Published: https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/i-built-second-brain-using-ai-its-changed-way-work-future-madden-0tote*

I've spent over 30 years in enterprise IT. I've led analyst teams, done corporate strategy, built & sold companies, and now I'm VP & Futurist at [Citrix](https://www.citrix.com/blogs/?s=bmadden&type=author/). All of that knowledge—every framework, every hard-won insight, every pattern I've learned to recognize—lived in one place: my head. If you wanted access to it, you had to talk to me. And even then, I could only leverage what I happened to remember in the moment.

Now it lives in a folder of plain text files on my laptop. And an AI reads all of them, maintains them, and builds on them every single day.

That's a second brain. The concept is simple. But living with it changes everything.

## So what does my second brain actually do?

If you're an advanced user of any AI today (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Copilot, whatever...), you probably often load files into a conversation for context, analysis, as a baseline for thinking, etc. Maybe you even formalize this by using a project workspace or a notebook so you can have several ongoing conversations using the same context and sets of files.

But at the end of every conversation, what do you do? You get some new ideas, you incorporate those into whatever you're working on, and maybe whatever finished product you create gets re-uploaded into AI as a source for the next conversation. This is great, and what I've been doing for the past year. The AI helped with a task, but the "knowledge management" is still very manual.

This is the bottleneck that the "second brain" fixes.

The second brain concept uses just one small tweak: Instead of loading all your files, outputs, notes, transcripts, and half-baked ideas *into* your AI system to set up the context for the "real" conversations and thinking, you flip it. Put all that stuff as text files in a folder on your laptop. Then tell your AI, "hey, everything you need for every conversation with me is in these files."

The AI can read, write, and edit these files. So in addition to pulling in everything it needs for every conversation, it can also write any updates or changes back into those files during every conversation. So now you have the self-updating, compounding system that truly changes everything.

I set this up just by talking to my AI. I told it: "Here are all my files—my frameworks, my half-formed ideas, my research, my blog posts, my positions on industry trends, my notes from every meeting. And every time we have a conversation, if anything we discuss connects back to any of this, *you* update the files. *You* notice when my thinking has shifted. *You* reconcile contradictions. *You* weave new insights into the existing knowledge base." I don't file anything. I don't tag anything. I just think and talk, and the system maintains the record.

So when I have a conversation about a product strategy on Monday, and then a meeting about product positioning on Wednesday, and then I'm rambling about a half-formed idea while staring out my window on Friday—the AI connects all three. It updates my competitive analysis, refines my positioning notes, and files the idea where it connects to both. I didn't ask it to do any of that. It just does, because those are the instructions it operates under.

This is how you solve the "AI sounds generic" complaints. Of course AI sounds generic if you give it a generic question with limited context—you're getting the median human answer based on training data. But when the AI has hundreds of files of *your* specific context—your frameworks, your positions, your evolving thinking, your writing, your style, the edits you made to the last draft it produced—the output isn't generic. It's *yours*.

When I ask it to write something, it doesn't "write in my voice", as that's the wrong way to describe it. It writes from the same accumulated knowledge, frameworks, and positions that I would draw on, because it has all of them. When I edit a draft, it learns from the edits. When I push back on a framing, that becomes part of how it thinks next time. After even just a few weeks of this, the compounding is remarkable. It produces drafts I look at and think—yeah, that's how I'd say it. Not because it's mimicking my style, but because it's working from the same foundation I work from.

And the system improves itself. It notices gaps in its own knowledge and asks me to fill them. It proposes better ways to organize what it's learned. It suggests connections between ideas I hadn't made. It's not a static reference library. It's my own knowledge, and it compounds daily.

## What using this actually feels like

Describing how this system works doesn't capture what it feels like to use it. So I'll try to describe what it feels like instead.

Think about a Steve Jobs keynote. Everyone talks about how great the iPhone launch presentation was. Nobody asks who edited the PowerPoint file. Jobs had meetings, talked about ideas, reviewed drafts, pushed back on framing—all that strategic back-and-forth *was* the work. The mechanical creation of the slides was always overhead. And no one thinks it wasn't a Steve Jobs presentation because he never opened PowerPoint.

That's what I'm doing now. Almost every part of my job is now intellectually interesting. The tedious stuff that used to consume mental cycles—formatting, organizing, scaffolding, transcribing ideas into structured documents—is gone. What's left is the hard thinking. I spend more of my day in genuine cognitive work than I did before.

This isn't AI thinking for me. It's AI handling the mechanical parts so I can focus on the strategic and creative parts.

Historically, to get this experience (only doing the interesting parts of your job) you had to be SVP-level with a whole staff. Someone else handled the formatting, the scheduling, the deck-building, the meeting logistics, the research prep. That's why senior execs describe their work differently than everyone else. They do the thinking and the deciding; other people handle the scaffolding.

A second brain gives everyone a staff. The "have a team" experience is no longer gated by your title. A mid-career analyst with a well-built second brain can operate with the same cognitive leverage as someone three levels up. That's a genuinely new thing in the world.

## Why this is the fundamental change where AI truly impacts the future of knowledge work

To explain why this second brain thing is such a big deal, we need to talk about what knowledge workers actually do all day.

Think about your own job. There's a visible part: writing emails, creating documents, attending meetings, scheduling things, filling out forms, formatting slides. This is the stuff that shows up in enterprise systems. IT can see it. Managers can measure it. It leaves a digital trail. Let's call that 20% of what you actually do.

Then there's the other 80%. The strategizing. The pattern recognition you've built up over years or decades. The moment when you connect something a customer said last week to a trend you've been tracking for six months. The half-formed thesis you're developing about where your market is headed. The judgment call about which opportunity to pursue, informed by everything you've ever learned about your industry. The conversation with a colleague where you suddenly realize two unrelated problems have the same root cause.

This 80% is the actual *knowledge* part of knowledge work. It's where the real value gets created. And it has always been invisible—to your employer, to your tools, and to every IT system ever built. It lives in your head and nowhere else. Even if you tried to capture these and write everything down, you'd spend so much time on the administrative overhead of capturing it that you'd have less time for actual thinking..

*[Chart: The visible 20% (emails, docs, scheduling, formatting—where Copilot, AI agents, and chatbots operate) vs. the invisible 80% (strategy, judgment, pattern recognition, connecting ideas, tacit expertise—where a second brain operates).]*

Now look at where every AI tool on the market is aimed. Copilot drafts your emails. Agents schedule your meetings. Chatbots summarize your documents. These are useful! But they're all operating on the visible 20%—the mechanical overhead, the scaffolding of work. Not the work itself.

No corporate AI tool touches the 80%. It can't. To reach the thinking, the strategizing, the judgment—the AI would need the accumulated context of *you*. Your frameworks. Your priors. Your positions. Your evolving understanding of your domain built over a career. No enterprise deployment has that, and no enterprise deployment *can* get it, because that knowledge has always lived exclusively inside your head.

A second brain is the first thing I've ever used that reaches the 80%. Mine knows my analytical frameworks, my positions on industry trends, my in-progress thinking, the connections I'm drawing between a podcast I heard last Tuesday and a strategy doc I wrote three months ago. When I think out loud to it, it continues my thinking—not from zero, but from everything I've already figured out up until that exact moment.

That's why this isn't a productivity hack. Enterprise AI automates the scaffolding. A second brain amplifies the cognition. One makes the overhead faster. The other makes the actual work better.

And once you see it this way, a lot of things start to make sense. Why do corporate AI programs feel underwhelming despite massive investment? They've been digitizing the 20%—the part that was already digital, already measurable, already overhead. The 80% where the real value lives was never digital before. Nobody had a way to reach it.

Now there is a way. And it's not a billion-dollar enterprise platform. It's a folder of text files and an AI that maintains them.

## Why this is happening right now

What I'm talking about is something that the people on the frontier of AI are starting to realize. Like, right now, literally late January / early February 2026.

So a fair question would be, "if this is so great, why wasn't everyone doing it a year ago?"

Flat out, the AI a year ago wasn't good enough. Something genuinely changed in Nov/Dec 2025. The models used for AI coding (Claude, GPT, and Gemini) got dramatically better at a specific set of skills: methodical planning, following their own instructions over long sessions, managing files and folders, maintaining consistency across a complex project. These skills are crucial for coders and why the internet was full of "OMG AI just broke coding" posts over the holidays. After all, if you're building a "real" app, you need AI that can hold a plan in its head, update dozens of files without losing track of dependencies, and follow a set of project instructions reliably.

It turns out those are *exactly the skills a second brain needs*. Maintaining a knowledge base is a project. It has files, structure, dependencies, instructions, and a need for consistency over time. The same AI capabilities that let developers hand off a complex codebase to an AI agent are what let me hand off my entire knowledge management to one.

And that's the thing I want to be clear about: I didn't build an app. This isn't vibe coding. I didn't write software or hire someone to create a product. I just pointed the same coding AI that developers use at my knowledge instead of a codebase. My "project" is my own brain. Same tool, different substrate.

This matters because it means the second brain isn't a product someone needs to build and sell you. It's a pattern that falls out naturally from AI capabilities that already exist. There's no app to buy, no platform to subscribe to, and no framework to learn. You're just using AI the way it already works—it's just that we now realized the coding tools work for *everything*, not just code.

I'm sure new patterns and better approaches will emerge as the models keep improving. But this is not a fad or a niche workflow. I truly believe this will "just be how AI works now," and over the next year or two, most knowledge workers will end up using some version of this whether they call it a "second brain" or not.

One more thing: It isn't magic. The AI doesn't have good ideas for you. It helps you develop your own ideas faster and with more connections to things you already know. If you don't have interesting thoughts to feed it, you get a well-organized collection of nothing. You still have to think. The AI just makes sure nothing you think gets lost, and everything you've already figured out is available the next time you need it.

I knew within two hours of setting this up that I would never go back. It was that quick. And after a few weeks, I can say with certainty that using AI in this way has fundamentally changed the way that I work, and I will never go back.

## What this changes about everything

Here's the thing: everything in my second brain is just files. Plain text files in a folder. I can read them. I can edit them. The AI can read them. The AI can edit them.

And I can share them.

That sentence has implications I'm still working through, and you can be sure this is what I'll be exploring both here on LinkedIn and in my role at Citrix, where I spend my time thinking about the future of knowledge work. Because I think a lot of what we assumed about knowledge work just got blown up.

Think about what I said earlier about the 80/20 split. Everything we've built for knowledge workers—every enterprise tool, every AI copilot, every productivity platform—was aimed at the visible 20%. That 20% was already a massive market. Billions of dollars. Entire industries.

But the 80% was untouchable. It lived in people's heads. You couldn't digitize it, connect it, share it, or build infrastructure around it.

Now you can.

And the implications go way beyond individual productivity. If my second brain is just files, I can connect it to other people's second brains. My colleague can publish a version of their thinking, and I can tell my AI: incorporate their perspective into my analysis. I can pull in my company's competitive intelligence. I can subscribe to an industry expert's knowledge base and have their frameworks woven into my own thinking. We're not just digitizing individual cognition—we're connecting cognitive infrastructure across people.

That changes the economics of expertise. How do you get paid for what you know when your knowledge is subscribable? What does it mean for your employer when institutional knowledge can be externalized, structured, and—let's be honest—taken with you? What about security, ownership, provenance? When an AI is weaving together insights from three different people's knowledge bases, who owns the output?

These aren't hypothetical questions. The technical infrastructure to do all of this exists today. MCP (Model Context Protocol) already lets AI systems connect to external data sources. Git already handles version control and collaboration. The plumbing is there. The questions are about governance, economics, and what work looks like when the invisible 80% becomes visible and connectable.

I don't have all the answers. But I know the questions are real, because I'm living them every day. And I'll be writing about them here as I work through it.

This is the future of knowledge work. Not AI that drafts your emails faster. AI that amplifies your actual thinking—and then connects it to everyone else's.
