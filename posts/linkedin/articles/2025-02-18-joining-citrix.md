# LinkedIn announcement from when I joined Citrix

I just joined Citrix!

Those who know me know I've spent my 30-year career orbiting Citrix. From the early years (last century!) when I worked with WinFrame & MetaFrame, lived on the THIN list, and earned my CCEA; to writing books on Citrix, VDI, and DaaS; to creating my blog, my independent Citrix master class, and the BriForum conference (a nod to Citrix's own iForum conference name), I've spent decades writing, speaking, and debating about VDI, DaaS, EUC and the future of work.

Yet despite all that, I never actually worked for Citrix.

Until now.

Today, I'm thrilled to share that I've joined Citrix as a full-time employee! (I'll continue to be based in Paris.)

So, why Citrix? And why now?

Quite simply, there's no more exciting place to be.

Citrix has always been about the future of work. Even though we didn't call it that in the '90s, I first saw that future when I did a complex update to an Oracle client on a WinFrame server that was instantly available to 15(!) employees. My mind was further blown when I realized the app performed the same for branch office workers 1000 miles away over a T1.

I remember that moment (at Telxon, in Akron, Ohio) like it was yesterday, and it changed everything for me.

I quickly embraced Citrix as my primary focus, and it was the topic of my first-ever public talk in August 1998. Back then, we talked about the benefits as "MAPS" (management, access, performance, and security). That evolved into the "any, any, any" (anywhere, anytime, any device) era as Citrix began to fundamentally transformation in how people worked.

Over the coming decades, my answer to "What would you say you do here?" evolved: SBC, ASP, VDI, DaaS, UEM, COIT, EUC, Digital Workspace, Workplace AI... Each of these was part of the bigger story of how work gets done.

Citrix evolved too, though their foundation has always been about securing the work—regardless of the worker, app, or platform—fundamentals as important today as they were 30 years ago.

If you've been following my posts & talks over the past few years, you know I believe we're in the midst of the biggest transformation of work in our lifetimes. Companies will need flexibility and adaptability to support more types of workers, on more platforms, using more applications than ever before. They'll need visibility and control. They'll need to simplify TCO. And above all, they'll need to secure the work, whatever that looks like in the future.

This is why I'm here.

Joining Citrix isn't just a job for me—it's the culmination of everything I've worked on for decades. Citrix has an incredible story to tell, and I'm honored to step into a role where I can help tell that story and shape its future.

The future of work isn't just a single moment or technology—it's an ongoing movement we've all been part of for decades. Thirty years from now, we'll laughingly look back at this moment like it's a 1990s T1, but sitting here today, I couldn't be more excited about what's ahead.

Let's go!
