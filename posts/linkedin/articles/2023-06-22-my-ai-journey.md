# My AI journey and the links that set the stage. ChatGPT is just the beginning!

Well, it happened. After 18 months of GitHub CoPilot and 6 months of ChatGPT, I'm one of those "AI people" now, I guess. It sort of caught me off guard. Like many of us, I never thought about AI apart from Sci-Fi movies or the occasional bar argument about the timing of The Singularity. My interest in AI has grown over the past few months as I've personally started using ChatGPT in more areas of my life. That led me to podcasts, blogs, AI meetups, party conversations, training nanoGPT models on my laptop, and most of my free time thinking about AI. I've been taking notes and collecting thoughts without any kind of specific goal—really just trying to wrap my own brain around what's happening and what it means.

Anyway, I'm going to organize and share some things here, and I figured the first step would be sharing links I love which set the conversation and stage for what's happening now.

## Bill Gates: The age of AI has begun

The first link I like to share is a Bill Gates piece, *The age of AI has begun*. He sets it up: The development of AI is as fundamental as the creation of the microprocessor, the personal computer, the Internet, and the mobile phone. It will change the way people work, learn, travel, get health care, and communicate with each other. Entire industries will reorient around it. Businesses will distinguish themselves by how well they use it.

This post is from March, so it's "old news" in AI time, but it's worth skimming because it's Bill Gates. My favorite takeaways are the concepts of everyone having their own AI personal agent (more on that in a bit) and the impact in education (customized AI tutors which are perfect for every learner).

## ChatGPT is shattering our world already!

Technologists argue that AI is technically not the same thing as ChatGPT, but when most regular people talk about AI, they're talking about generative AIs like ChatGPT or DALL-E. (Get ready for the GPT hype cycle—this decade's version of, "When all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail!")

But for the 100 million of us who've used ChatGPT, is it a party trick, a tool, or a life changing experience? The answer depends on your perspective and experience. My favorite "ChatGPT is changing things" is this Atlantic story from a college professor who went from loving their job at the beginning of this past school year (Sept '22) to realizing their career as a professor is over before the year ended (May '23). "ChatGPT? Never heard of it!" to: "ChatGPT ended my career as a professor!" in the span of a single school year.

## We're all figuring out ChatGPT together

But once the initial party trick awe wears off, ChatGPT users divide into two groups: Those who start using it all the time, and those who think, "meh." A big difference between these two groups is the effort they put into learning how to use ChatGPT properly. Like all tools, if you just walk up to it and start pushing buttons, it will work, but you won't be getting the most out of it.

LinkedIn is full of click-baity listicles "100 ChatGPT prompts to take your career to the next level!", but taking a few minutes to learn how to write proper prompts will drastically change your experience. I can't tell you how many people have said, "ChatGPT has a long way to go. I asked it to do X and it wasn't helpful." But spend 5 minutes learning about prompts and you'll think you were using a completely different tool!

There's a huge list of example prompts on GitHub! Everyone talks about how prompting is an art, not a science, but fortunately this is art you can imitate. There's a GitHub repo called Awesome ChatGPT Prompts which is just a huge list of prompts people submit which you can browse through.

## AI Prompting to AI Whispering to AI Response Shaping

Hopefully you're starting to realize that the power of ChatGPT—or any generative AI—is tied to whatever you give it as input. While there's a lot of focus on creating great prompts, the real next-level is to get beyond the prompt. I love this post from Daniel Miessler, *Response Shaping: How to Move from AI "Prompts" to AI Whispering*.

## Who deserves credit?

A big part of the AI conversation now is about credit (ownership, copyright, plagiarism, compensation, recognization, etc.) I already mentioned that AI is more than just generative models, (like GPT, but also the photo-based ones, Midjourney, DALL-E, Stable Diffusion), but since generative models are all the rage right now, many of the "AI issues" people talk about are actually "generative model issues."

On one hand, people say that art (whether written, visual, etc.) created by a computer based on a human prompt should not be attributed to the person who wrote the prompts. ("All they did was type a few words! Anyone can do that!") Funny, though, that's what painters said about photographers when cameras were first invented. ("That's not art! All they did was point that machine at what they wanted a painting of and press a button! Anyone can do that!") But of course today we recognize photography as art, just like we recognize film directors as artists who just tell the actors what they want.

That said, there are a lot of unresolved issues around the training data for these AI generators, including the obvious complexities around credit, compensation, and disclosure, right down to the fact that these models could be another version of tech companies strip mining value from other people's work.

## What's next after ChatGPT?

Assuming these questions get resolved, (well, they will probably never be fully resolved, but as a society we'll just sorta move on), what's next for AI beyond the generative models? Personally I'm most excited about the concept of everyone having their own AI-powered digital assistant. I love the idea that everyone's own AI will be personalized and an expression of them, similar to their mobile device choice, but that there will be lots of other AIs. (Companies will have them, the government, restaurants, stores, Netflix.) Your AI will interact with all these other AIs taking care of many of the life things we all have to do now.

Looking beyond that, the first three phases of the post-GPT world are things we've discussed here, but the next three phases get wild as we start thinking about what it means to be human and what knowledge work is. (Many people believe AI will finally lead to the productivity enhancements that digitization and computers were supposed to deliver in the 80s and 90s.)

## Finally, how wild will software development be?

Even though don't identify as a software developer per se, I spend a lot of time writing code. I already mentioned that I rely on GitHub CoPilot daily. (Working offline without it now feels weird.) And I've started asking ChatGPT to write more and more chunks of code, definitely noticing the increase in complexity of what I'm asking over the months.

But we're about to experience a renaissance in the software development world as these generative AI models are able to write code and interact with APIs and do all sorts of things which used to require an experienced and expensive human.

I love the idea that so much software "programming" moving forward will just be human language prompts. For example, the GitHub CoPilot Chat feature had its programming leaked. I love how this is more of a super-detailed job description and not actual computer code. It's something a product manager or HR person would write.

I also mentioned that I downloaded nanoGPT and trained it (from scratch) on my laptop with all the books and articles I've written. Even with only an hour of training, this thing is blowing my mind. (And definitely hilarious. It's almost more of an "early 2000s Citrix industry joke meme generator." I'll have to do a separate post on that.)

Anyway, this is a starting point for this ongoing conversation. I've got pages of ideas and notes and I talk to people about this every day. It's cool to be aware of how impactful a technology is as it's happening, so let's see where this goes!

## About the header image

The image for this article was generated with DALL-E using the prompt, after a few revisions: "president taft walking towards the intoxicating light of a high tech future. make it cyber punkish, but also clear that it's from the early 1900s." The final image was adjusted with their online editing tools including adding more generation zones using additional prompts.
