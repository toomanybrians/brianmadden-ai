Hey creators and experts: I will pay to subscribe to your brain.

I don't mean your substack, I mean I'll pay for a feed of full text transcripts of everything you publish, maybe along with your other thoughts and opinions, which I'll merge into my own second brain so I can more easily incorporate your perspectives & thinking into my personal AI knowledge system. Since you're already putting the content out there in public, it's already possible for anyone to incorporate. I just want to make it easier, and pay you for it.

Quick catch-up: I recently [built a personal AI knowledge system which I call my "second brain"](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/i-built-second-brain-using-ai-its-changed-way-work-future-madden-0tote/) that's essentially a folder of text files on my laptop that an AI reads, maintains, and compounds daily. It includes all my frameworks, positions, and publicly published materials, as well as my accumulated thinking from 32 years in enterprise IT. It's all structured, queryable, and building on itself every day. (And it's all maintained by AI, which has recently gotten really good at this kind of thing.)

This is essentially what Matthew Call wrote about in The Wall Street Journal when he discussed [workers using personal AI systems](https://www.wsj.com/lifestyle/careers/ai-knowledge-capture-employees-a69a0e1c?st=myEUCi&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink). Using my second brain has fundamentally shifted how I work. This is my "[Move 37 Moment](https://www.coloradoai.news/human-input-maicon-2025s-move-37-moment-that-marketers-cant-ignore/)" for AI at work.

Once I got my second brain up and running, I started plugging the external knowledge sources I rely on: RSS feeds, podcasts, email newsletters, etc. Some of them are easy (newsletters and blogs already have the full text I can merge right in). Some podcasts share full text transcripts (yay!), and others are run through an AI model which listens to the MP3 and spits out the text. The same is true for YouTube videos.

Even though copyright law suggests it's fair use to ingest any work acquired legally into an AI system, I prefer and am happy to pay creators for their work. So I started going through [my list](https://bmad.com/links/) of the people I follow to see if I could pay them for clean access to their content, but it seems like that's not really a thing. That led to a realization:

## The creator economy has a problem

Everyone's talking about how sloppy low-cost AI-generated content is negatively impacting creators who are struggling with existential questions like:

- What's my value when AI can generate a decent version of what I do?
- How do I stay ahead when anything I publish is instantly ripped, remixed, & republished before my followers can even consume it?
- Is it even worth creating content anymore while my revenue dives?
- Do I trust the platforms to steward my content? How do I keep and own what's actually mine?
- What do my readers & followers truly want?

The instinct of many creators is to double down: more content, AI-assisted script writing & production, and a faster publishing cadence. That's unsustainable and not even enough. No human can out-produce AI in a world where content has been turned into a factory widget. Plus the only way they can compete is to lean into AI help which starts to blur the line between what I'm paying them for and the AI slop that's threatening them.

The only way out is for creators, experts, & influencers to stop playing this game. Here's what I propose:

## What I actually want from experts, and what I'd pay for

I'll walk you through my thinking based on a real life scenario from last week. I love the analysis of Nate B. Jones, an AI strategist whose [YouTube videos are a "must watch" for me](https://www.youtube.com/@NateBJones), and usually pretty relevant to my own work about AI's impact on and the future of knowledge work. (If you don't know Nate, watch [these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtMLnCMv3do) [two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZxyeYBxPBA) videos and come back in an hour. You're welcome.)

For the past year or so, (before I built my second brain), I watched Nate's videos and just sort of hoped I'd remember the important bits. For videos that were especially relevant to something I was working on, I'd clumsily copy-paste the transcripts from the YouTube website into a local text file (something which YouTube makes difficult, I assume to prevent people like me from doing the exact thing I'm doing).

Nate has a substack and a newsletter, and while they don't map 1:1 to his YouTube content, I wondered if I subscribed if I could get a feed to his YouTube transcripts which I could then feed into my second brain. (That's not an option, as far as I can tell.)

But then I thought, what if instead of consuming his content, I could subscribe to his knowledge directly? Imagine being able to plug in his writings, positions, big ideas, and worldview directly into my second brain as a reference layer that my AI can draw on alongside my own?

I'd pay $100/month for that without hesitating.

This solves a big problem in a new way. People don't just want to watch experts. They want to integrate experts into their own thinking infrastructure.

The reason that books, newsletters, substack, and educational YouTube videos exist is because people want to consume the content, process it, and figure out how to wire it into their own thinking, frameworks, and outputs.

The bottleneck is that a newsletter/book/video/speech is something you read and forget. A subscribable brain is infrastructure that compounds inside every subscriber's system.

This would be like the matrix for brain skills.

## How this actually works (it's real and possible today)

This isn't hypothetical. The plumbing exists today.

My second brain is a structured markdown repository—just plain text files organized by topic, framework, and evolving position. (I literally just asked my AI to build it with a [prompt like this](https://gist.github.com/toomanybrians/4c64f3f6774caee6feff9b0b12172867).) It lives in GitHub and my AI keeps everything up to date based on every conversation, input, and output. I maintain this as part of my normal daily workflow.

The subscribable brain is the same thing. Think of it as the structured version of everything they've ever figured out, kept current as their thinking evolves.

As the subscriber, I would sync the expert's repo (or get access via [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/getting-started/intro)). Then my AI reads the expert's knowledge alongside my own, woven into the same thinking environment. When I ask my AI to help me think through a strategy question, it would draw on my 32 years of experience, plus Nate's knowledge and whatever other experts I've subscribed to, all at once.

The technical stack is almost comically simple. A GitHub repo for the knowledge. Git for version control and updates. GitHub Sponsors or a similar mechanism for subscription management. MCP for the AI integration layer. There's no app to build or platform to create. This is all possible today.

## Why this is different from everything that came before

The past 25 years of my livelihood has depended on content I've created. (I published my first book in 2001, started blogging in 2003, built training courses & DVDs in 2004, and podcasting in 2005.)

Despite all the "Web 2.0" and "social influencer" trends, most content creation is still a one-way broadcast. The creator makes it, the audience reads or consumes it, and the value transfer is complete. One and done. A subscribable brain converts content to infrastructure. It lives inside the subscriber's system and compounds with everything else they know. The value isn't in any one single piece of content, but rather the accumulation, the structure, and the way it interacts with the subscriber's own knowledge.

This is like the difference between reading a book and having the author looking over your shoulder helping you shape everything you create and think about. This is also the part AI can't generate, because the knowledge isn't just the words, but the thinking behind them.

## The economics are wild

For creators, this concept changes the math completely. Right now, monetizing expertise means constant production. You have to keep publishing, keep recording, and keep posting, or your revenue stops. A subscribable brain flips this. The creator maintains their knowledge as part of their normal workflow. This is the same thinking, writing, & interacting with their personal AI system that they'd be doing anyway. There is literally zero incremental production effort. The creator's maintenance of their own second brain is also their product.

For subscribers, compare this to what you're paying now for content & knowledge from experts you trust. A newsletter: $10-20/month. An online course: $500-2000 one-time. An industry analyst subscription: $5,000-50,000/year. A consulting engagement to get an expert's frameworks applied to your problems: $25,000+ each time.

A subscribable brain sits somewhere between the newsletter and the analyst subscription in terms of value, but the delivery mechanism is fundamentally better. You're not getting a PDF to read. You're getting a living knowledge system that compounds inside your own knowledge infrastructure, that your AI can reason over, and that gets better every time the expert refines their thinking.

Now multiply this by all the experts who are important to you. What if you could subscribe to three or four of the smartest people in your field? Your AI weaves their perspectives together with your own and you'd have a synthesis engine that draws on multiple knowledge bases simultaneously. That's not something any consulting firm offers at any price. (Don't go too far and add "everyone in the world" because that's what AI is already which is why its generic answers are median slop.)

And it's not just whole brains; you could subscribe to different facets. My second brain has writing style guides that shape how my AI writes for me. What if I could subscribe to the voice of my favorite author or humorist? Not their content, but how they think about language, rhythm, and structure? This would be like actors licensing their AI likenesses, except for the written word. An author's voice, a strategist's frameworks, or a designer's principles could each be a subscribable module you plug into your own system.

## This is also great in the corporate world

The enterprise implications are just as real and powerful. Consulting firms charge $500/hour for the frameworks inside their consultants' heads. What happens when those frameworks are subscribable for $200/month? Industry analysts charge $50,000/year for access to research that takes weeks to produce, or $20,000 for a one-time meeting. What happens when the underlying knowledge is available as a living system that updates in real time?

The old joke about the big consulting firms is that they sell you a partner's expertise and then send in a team of 25-year-olds who just graduated. But what if those 25-year-olds brought firm's entire accumulated knowledge base wired into their second brains? Every framework, every past engagement's lessons learned, and every senior partner's hard-won pattern recognition, all available to a first-year consultant in real time. The junior people would instantly have the judgment layer of the senior people. (This is either terrifying or transformational depending on which side of the billing rate you're on.)

This concept is just as huge inside any company. What happens when your best people can externalize their institutional knowledge into subscribable brains? The retiring VP with 30 years of operational wisdom doesn't have to take it all with them. They can structure it, subscribe the team, and their knowledge compounds inside the organization long after they're gone. And, the VP wouldn't have to do anything differently or specifically for this. They just use their second brain every day, (the same way I use mine and the same way I believe every knowledge worker will operate in the near future), and the subscribable version is a natural byproduct. The work *is* the product.

This would also be huge to get workers to integrate corporate perspectives into all their work thinking and products. Every company has institutional knowledge that's supposed to shape how people work: brand voice guides, corporate reputation frameworks, "how we think about things" documents that marketing and HR create, etc. What if all of that was a subscribable brain module that gets wired into every employee's AI? Instead of today's mess of SharePoint docs, this would be a living layer that's threaded through everything the workers create and every decision they think through. Style guides would actually get followed. Strategic frameworks would finally get applied. Heck, the latest AI models have gotten really good at creating PowerPoint presentations, so now you can hook one into the corporate deck template, the brand style guide, and the company's strategic messaging framework, and when any employee uses their second brain to coauthor a presentation, it comes out perfect: on brand, on message, and properly formatted, every time, from every person in the company. That is a fundamentally different thing than what exists today. (And, for real, this is all possible today.)

This isn't about replacing experts. It's about changing the delivery mechanism for expertise from "content you consume" to "infrastructure you integrate." The experts become more valuable, not less, because now their knowledge reaches further and compounds faster.

## This is the future of knowledge transfer

I feel absolutely certain that this is what's coming. The pieces are all here: MCP, git, markdown, and AI systems that can reason over structured knowledge. They will be put together into a platform where experts publish their brains and subscribers plug them in. When they do, it won't look like Substack or Patreon or Coursera. It'll look like infrastructure. Boring, useful, compounding knowledge infrastructure.

In the meantime, I'm looking forward to replacing all my content subscriptions with knowledge subscriptions. Nate, if you're reading this, I'm your first paying customer whenever you're ready!
