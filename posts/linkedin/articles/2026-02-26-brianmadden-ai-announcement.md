# Announcing brianmadden.ai: I just published my brain for you to merge into your AI

*Brian Madden—February 26, 2026*
*Published on LinkedIn*

A few weeks ago I wrote about how I used AI to build a personal compounding knowledge system, (what some call a "second brain"), which fundamentally changed how I work. Then last week I suggested that experts should stop publishing content and instead publish their knowledge as modules anyone can plug into their own AI.

Today I'm happy to announce that I'm doing that, at brianmadden.ai, which is open source and live today!

The brianmadden.ai repo contains all my published thinking on AI and the future of knowledge work based on my 32 years of expertise: all my Citrix blogs, LinkedIn posts, podcasts & speech transcripts, 9 standalone frameworks, and a 30,000-word synthesis that connects everything I've written. It's all structured so any AI assistant can load it and reason with my perspective.

So the "audience" for this is your AI system, not you.

You can connect to it right now. It takes about 10 seconds.

## How to connect

brianmadden.ai is available as an MCP server (Model Context Protocol, the open standard for connecting AI tools to external data.) In whatever AI tool you use (Claude, ChatGPT, Copilot, Gemini), go to settings, find connectors or extensions or MCP, and add:

brianmadden.ai/mcp

That's it. Your AI can now draw on my full body of work during your normal conversations. There's no app to install, no account to create, and no subscription to manage. (Step-by-step instructions for specific tools are at brianmadden.ai/connect.)

The full source is available on GitHub (toomanybrians/brianmadden-ai), where you can browse everything, fork it, or use it as a starting point for your own. (If you have your own second brain, you can pull this into your own filesystem and have it integrated fully.)

## What to do with it

This is much more than a fancy FAQ where you ask it questions and get my canned answers. The real value is using my thinking as a layer inside your own.

Ask it something: "What's Brian's invisible 80% framework?" or "Why does Brian think most enterprise AI investments are aimed at the wrong problem?" You'll get a sourced, opinionated answer grounded in specific published pieces—noticeably different from what your AI produces on its own. And when you ask about something I haven't written about, it says so rather than making something up.

Apply it to your situation: "We spent $2M on AI tools and nobody's using them. Use Brian's frameworks to figure out what we're getting wrong." or "Apply the invisible 80% to my industry—we're a mid-market healthcare firm with 2,000 knowledge workers and a stalled Copilot rollout." Now my frameworks are working on your problem, not just sitting in a blog post nobody found.

Co-develop your own ideas: This is where it gets interesting. "I've been thinking that AI governance is really a workforce trust problem, not a security problem. Push back on this using Brian's frameworks—where am I right, where am I wrong, and what am I missing?" or "Here's my draft AI strategy. Where does it overlap with Brian's thinking, where does it diverge, and where should I steal his frameworks?" You're not asking me questions. You're using my 32 years of pattern recognition as a whetstone for your own thinking.

That last part is the whole point. A blog post is something you read and forget. This is a reference layer that your AI weaves into your own reasoning process—available every time you think through a problem, not just when you happen to remember something I wrote.

## What your AI just got access to

brianmadden.ai contains all of my published work on AI and knowledge work: my Citrix blog posts, LinkedIn articles and posts, speech and podcast transcripts, and the frameworks I've developed publicly—the invisible 80%, workspace-as-control-plane, the cognitive stack, the five levels of AI in knowledge work, and others.

But the content is only half the story. What makes this a knowledge system rather than a content dump is the connecting tissue: files that tell any AI how everything relates, which ideas are authoritative versus still forming, how a new post extends or challenges an earlier one, and what I'm currently thinking about topics I've already written about publicly.

When I publish something new and it connects to an idea from six months ago, that connection gets captured. So your AI doesn't just search my content—it gets a map to the architecture of my thinking.

This knowledge is not frozen in time, as it updates as my thinking evolves, (sometimes several times a day). It's not a chatbot or a digital twin, as it doesn't simulate me or pretend to be me. On its own, brianmadden.ai is just text files. It only becomes useful when your AI loads it, the same way a web server only becomes useful when a browser connects. Your AI handles the conversation and applies its own guardrails. brianmadden.ai provides the source material.

I am not publishing my full private knowledge system, but rather this is a curated subset based on all the my work which is already published. I have shared my governance document which defines what goes in, what stays out, and how the publishing process works. Everything in the module is already public, and the repo consolidates it and adds structure and AI accessibility.

## I think nobody has done this before, but this is the future of knowledge sharing

There are a lot of second brains that people share, but from what I can tell, they're designed for human consumption: HTML pages of hyperlinked notes you click through and read. brianmadden.ai is different because it has AI loading instructions, a knowledge hierarchy, and is designed as a data source that plugs into someone else's AI workflow.

I mention this because I think a year from now there will be thousands of these (I hope!), and I want people to see what the format looks like so they can build their own. The repo is public specifically for this reason.

## Why I'm doing this

The main reason is because last week I wrote that all experts and influencers should do this, so I figured I should do it too. Plus if I really do believe this is the future of knowledge work (which I do), then the more time I spend in this world, the better prepared I will be for the future.

But there's also a much more practical reason. Since joining Citrix last year, I have written over 45,000 words across 30+ blog posts. That's a full book! But no one is going to read all that to "catch up" on my perspective. The best someone could do was "pick a few random blog posts and hope you chose well." With brianmadden.ai, they load the module and say "catch me up on Brian's thinking about X" and get a coherent, sourced answer drawn from everything I've written.

So I'm not asking anyone to read more. Instead I'm going directly into the tool they're already using to think.

## The bigger picture

Every content format that exists—blogs, newsletters, podcasts, webinars, white papers—was designed for humans to consume. In the future, content will need to be created for AI to consume. And I'm not talking about the "simple repainting" and AIO/GEO optimization of websites from HTML to LLM-friendly formats. (That is a fast horse.)

The future will be new forms of content that AI systems will share directly, and I think brianmadden.ai is an early experiment in that direction. It's my first published content designed for an AI to consume.

This is not an incremental improvement to content distribution. It's a fundamentally different model for how expertise reaches people. Instead of reading someone's book, you plug their knowledge into your own thinking infrastructure. Instead of hoping a Google search finds the right blog post, you have interactive access to their full body of work, structured by the person who actually wrote it, inside the tool you're already using to work.

I wrote in the subscribable brains article that I'd pay $100/month to plug Nate B. Jones's thinking directly into my AI. I meant it, and I think a lot of knowledge workers feel the same way about the experts they follow. The bottleneck has been that nobody was publishing their knowledge in a format that makes this possible. So now someone is!

The economics are wild. The infrastructure is basically free. (GitHub + Cloudflare) The creator's daily maintenance of their own knowledge system is the product, with zero incremental production cost to share a portion of it. If this pattern spreads (and I wrote about why I think it will), the creator economy will shift from "content you consume" to "infrastructure you integrate." The human expert becomes more valuable in that world, not less, because their knowledge compounds inside every subscriber's system.

## What's next

I don't know exactly where this goes. I'll be sharing what works, what doesn't, and what I learn—full transparency, including the bumps.

Try it! Tell me what you think. And if you want to build your own, feel free to fork the repo, point your AI at it, and start from there.
