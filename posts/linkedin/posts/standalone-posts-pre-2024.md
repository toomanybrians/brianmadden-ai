This is a list of LinkedIn posts (actual "posts", not "articles") that I, Brian Madden, VP Technology Officer & Futurist at Citrix have posted to LinkedIn. This list is only "standalone" posts, e.g. ones that are not reposts and that do not link to blog posts, speeches, etc.

A lot of people are using the terms "ChatGPT" and "AI" interchangeably. But  really ChatGPT is just one specific implementation of one specific type of AI. I explain all this in this article, as well as showing a "family tree" taxonomy of how these models all fit together.

Whelp, I too have been bitten by the generative AI bug over the past few months. I've been reading, learning, and talking about this stuff every day, so I decided to start sharing some notes and thoughts. Today's post is a level-set and a bunch of links I like as a starting point to frame the conversation. Holy moly this is wild!

20 years ago today, I self-published my first book, "Citrix MetaFrame XP: Advanced Technical Design Guide". This book played a big part in launching the public phase of my career and directly led to BrianMadden.com, BriForum, the training classes & DVDs, the creation of the Citrix CTP program, etc. This book (along with the second edition with the orange on the cover) would go on to sell 60,000 copies over the next 8 years! At one point in 2002 it had a sales ranking of #31 on Amazon.com. (That's across all books, not just tech books!) It also led to the other books I published, totaling over 100k copies sold. Seems like only yesterday...

This meme has been circulating, but it’s not accurate. My edits below fix it. To be clear, this is *not* a joke, it’s a GOOD thing. If working from home meant 10x more working, no one would do it. The amount of work we do in the office versus at home is not too different. What’s different is when working from home, the in-fill time can be “ours” versus random office BS.

Over the weekend, TechTarget shut down BrianMadden.com. Most of the thousands of stories and posts I wrote in my career are gone, replaced with 404 Page Not Found errors. They'll start to disappear from the search engines' results soon, and then the site will be nothing more than memories us old-timers carry around.

I still used the site quite a bit, mostly when looking into EUC history since BrianMadden.com was as close to the "paper of record" as anything this industry had—especially when you look at all the conversations and comments around the posts. But the world has moved on. The conversations are now on social media, not blogs, content is shorter, and business models are different. 

Funny though, I created a conference we did 20 times around the world, but what evidence is there of that? (Just memories!) I wrote over 2,000 articles, but what evidence is there of that? (memories!) This is the circle of life, but the sudden, "Hey the majority of your life's work just vanished from the universe over the weekend" is an unexpected Monday.

The site's legacy is not its content, but the community that formed around it. We all believed we could impact this industry by sharing what we know, and I'm happy that's living on today!

My eulogy for BrianMadden.com:

Imagine you wake up to find an email from your boss telling you that you have to come up with a plan to allow 80% of your users to work remotely. ASAP. Now what? (And no, it's not about what product you need to buy because there's not enough time for that.)

PowerPoint is a tool, not a document type.

Unfortunately it's not possible to create a single "powerpoint" that can be used for large stage, small room, printed handouts, leave behinds, emailed, etc. Each scenario requires its own document type. Many of these generic "corporate decks" are just that: generic.

Why the Motorola Atrix sucked: My main complaint was that having the laptop-sized "dock" that didn't do anything was worthless. If you're carrying something the size of a laptop around, why not carry an actual laptop (ultrabook/netbook/etc) that could actually do useful work? They're the same price. This stupid webtop dock thing only worked when your phone was plugged in. People said this was good because you had all your data and apps with you. Well guess what? A USB sync cable from your regular phone to your laptop *also* means you have everything with you, PLUS the option to use the laptop.
