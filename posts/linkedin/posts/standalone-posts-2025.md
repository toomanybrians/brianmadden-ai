This is a list of LinkedIn posts (actual "posts", not "articles") that I, Brian Madden, VP Technology Officer & Futurist at Citrix have posted to LinkedIn. This list is only "standalone" posts, e.g. ones that are not reposts and that do not link to blog posts, speeches, etc.

"Knowledge worker automation" is absurd, right??

All the AI vendors are pushing "AI powered automation studios", which are cool, but also I think too many people are making too much of a big deal about them.

These are a point-in-time stepping stone solution, NOT the be-all, end-all to how AI will help knowledge workers.

For one, knowledge worker tasks are (by definition), varied, random, and different every day. (If they did the same thing every day, we would call them "task workers". 😜)

Also, using these AI automation studios requires people to stop working and spend time trying to learn, study, figure out, etc. Who has time for that? This is why "learn about AI automations" has been on peoples' to-do lists for 12 months.

So, yeah, maybe a few % of knowledge workers build some automations, but 95%+ will not and will experience AI when it's more able to meet them where they are.

It's official! The leading AI computing using agent (CUA) now scores higher than humans in the OSWorld benchmark for real-world tasks in computer environments.

Simular Research Agent S3: 72.6%
Humans: 72.4%

Six months ago, the best AI agents scored 45%. A year ago it was 17%, and eighteen months ago, the best scored 12%.

I've written quite a bit on why computer-using agents will be huge for enterprise knowledge workers, and how it's inevitable that they'll use the same desktops, apps, and workspaces as human workers. The question was always "when," not "if."

To be clear, hitting human parity on a benchmark doesn't mean CUAs are ready to replace workers now. The benchmark tests raw UI execution—can the agent click the right buttons, navigate menus, and complete task based on plain-language instructions? It doesn't test judgment, context, knowing why to do something, or handling the weird edge cases that fill every real workday.

But that's exactly the point. The "hands and eyes" part of computer work is pretty much solved. What remains is the orchestration & scaffolding that tells agents what to do, when, and with what guardrails.

For enterprise IT, this changes the conversation. It's no longer about whether AI can operate your legacy apps. It can. Now it's about where those agents will run, how you'll secure them, and who provides the oversight.

The future interface for ALL knowledge work is going to be AI. Full stop.

Not an AI-powered app. Not copilots embedded in your existing tools. I'm saying the AI platform itself will become the primary way you interact with your apps, data, and work environment. Everything else will become infrastructure that AI operates on your behalf.

I know that sounds wacky. So I wrote a post walking through exactly how we get there (within the constraints of your existing enterprise systems, not some fantasy where everything gets rebuilt as AI-native).

This is my second cornerstone post. It's long (2k words), but worth it, as it lays out (along with my 7-stages of human-AI collaboration) how AI will enter the enterprise workforce over the next few years.

The short version:

AI platforms (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.) already have four pathways to reach everything in your environment: connectors to modern apps, browser control for web apps, computer-using agents for legacy desktop apps, and direct file manipulation that skip the apps entirely.

Workers won't consciously "choose AI over apps." They'll just notice one day that they haven't opened Excel in two months. 🤷‍♂️ The shift will happen through accumulated trust over time, not a point-in-time decision.

And no, this doesn't mean everything becomes AI slop. AI will handle the brokering and navigation, but you'll still bring judgment to the actual work.

I've been building toward this piece for months. It ties together the 7-stage roadmap, the CUA benchmarks, the AI file manipulation stuff, and the "boring infrastructure" concepts into a single thesis.

The link is in comments. Let me know what you think!

How will AI succeed in the workplace? Aaron Levie spells it out perfectly here.

The challenge isn't how good/smart/connected the AI is. The challenge is the integration. Enterprises already have the apps, data, and processes that make their businesses run. The hard part is creating a secure, consistent environment where AI can actually work alongside all of what you actually have today, without requiring big changes.

Sidebar: Aaron Levie's posts here on AI in the workplace are fantastic. Definitely worth following.

If AI can edit files (xlsx, pptx) directly, why do we need apps?

I recently experienced Claude editing an XLSX file without using Excel. 🤯

If an AI can read, write, transform, and/or orchestrate any file, service, or data source, then the "app" stops being valuable, replaced by the "capabilities" of the AI.

So what's next? Capabilities, pipelines, policies, on-demand ephemeral visual surfaces... But certainly not legacy UI that was built for humans.

This is going to be a big change for end user computing and certainly a bigger deal than just throwing computer using agents (CUAs) at all your legacy apps.

This is what I explore in this week's blog post: https://lnkd.in/gydvkGqE

Anyone else seeing how workers with access to AI tools is on a path to 100X the number of apps in an environment?

They're asking AI to "just quickly build something" to solve their problems. That competitive analysis dashboard? Built in 12 minutes. That workflow automation? Created during a coffee break. That data processor? Whipped up between meetings.

AI has turned every knowledge worker into an accidental citizen developer. They don't think of themselves as developers, or course, in their minds they're just solving problems. But each solution is "technically" an application, right? It processes data, accesses systems, runs on a schedule, and uses whatever credentials the creator happens to have.

In the old days, enterprises had a ratio of 10 users to 1 app. I think we're about to see that invert, to 10 apps per every user!

This is so beyond "shadow" IT. It's parallel IT! There's about to be a whole universe of apps running outside your governance, growing exponentially.

So what do you do? How do you think about approaching this? That's what I explore in today's post: https://lnkd.in/gjqfyXJQ

Your enterprise AI strategy is losing to your workers' $20 ChatGPT subscriptions.

There's a famous concept in AI research called "the bitter lesson." Throughout history, simple methods that scale ALWAYS beat more clever, engineered solutions.

Now that bitter lesson has come to enterprise AI.

While IT departments spend millions on:
• Custom AI models 
• Complex governance frameworks
• "Enterprise-grade" solutions 
• Elaborate integration projects

Their workers are getting better results with ChatGPT, Claude, and a browser extension.

Those workers aren't doing "shadow AI." They're showing you the path forward. The simplest solution isn't a workaround. It's wisdom. (h/t Occam's Razor)

Your job isn't to build them something better. It's to make what they're already using safer and more powerful.

I dig deeper into why fighting this trend is futile (and what you should do instead) in my latest post:

What's your take? Are enterprises over-engineering AI?

There's a fascinating paper making waves called "AI as Normal Technology" that argues AI will transform society like electricity did. (Profoundly, yes, but over decades, not months.) AI accelerationists and skeptics agree in their disdain for this paper, which means the authors are probably onto something. 😇 

So let's pull at this thread... If AI really is "normal technology" that will take years to fully mature & integrate, then your boring, stable infrastructure becomes your most strategic asset. Not your AI strategy. Not your innovation labs. But the boring infrastructure that runs your business day after day. (For IT operations folks, boring is good!)

At Citrix, we've spent 35 years making boring infrastructure 😎 that bridges old and new. Turns out that's exactly what you need when your workers are building the future while IT tries to contain it.

Stop reducing worker-led AI efforts to "just" BYO or shadow AI.

I recently wrote that most traditional, IT-led AI initiatives struggle, and that the "real" transformation is happing at the edge, with workers using tools like ChatGPT to do their jobs better. Most people, when hearing this, say, "Ah.. it's shadow IT!"

I shout, "NO!", because it's so much more than that! I don't want to diminish and reduce what workers are doing on their own to "just" BYO-AI or shadow IT.

Seriously, rank-and-file knowledge workers trial & erroring ChatGPT, Gemini, Grok, Claude, etc. is where the real innovation and transformation is happening around AI in the enterprise today.

Everyone’s wrong about why enterprise AI is failing.

That NYT article, that McKinsey report, that MIT Media Lab study... they're all basically saying that companies are spending millions on AI with no measurable results.

But they're all missing the point. IT-led gen AI projects either (1) go wide (copilots & chatbots for all) with limited utility and no measurable impact, or (2) go deep (transform some process in a huge way which is in theory awesome and has measurable impact, but is also complex, expensive, gets crushed by the status quo, etc.)

So yeah, I get it, IT-led gen AI projects are tough. But this is not the kind of AI I focus on when I talk about AI in the workplace or how AI will transform knowledge work.

My focus is the AI that individual workers use and want to bring into the workplace: ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, Grok, etc. These tools are transforming employees' work every day. The only thing holding them back is their company which doesn't let them connect to corporate systems and data.

Doing this right will be a lot of work, and not without challenges. But the payoff is immense and the work is worth doing. There are plenty of steps companies can take today.

So ChatGPT-5 dropped last week and the internet is having a moment.

“That’s it?”
“Where’s the AGI we were promised?”
“AI bubble confirmed!”

But from an enterprise standpoint, I'm not sure how much this matters. Even if all AI development stopped today—if every AI lab shut down and not a single new model was ever trained again—we’d still have 5+ years of transformation ahead of us just to integrate what already exists.

If every knowledge worker leveraged AI as much as I do today, the world of business would be drastically different. There's so much for enterprise workspace owners to think about today. This is what I explore in this week's blog post: https://lnkd.in/d6aMaYaA

Everyone’s excited about the OpenAI open weights model. “Save money and run ChatGPT on your own!” But not so fast.

ChatGPT is more than an LLM or a chatbot nowadays. It’s an entire platform with dozens of integrated tools, including:

• Text, image, audio, and video generation and processing
• Web browsing and deep research
• Python execution and code toolchains
• Local desktop app integration (command line terminal, editors, IDEs)
• Agentic actions like launching browsers and interacting with SaaS apps
• Scheduled and repeatable workflows
• Meeting recording and advanced voice modes
• Full-featured mobile and desktop apps with native system integration (notifications, hand offs, etc.)
• Project scaffolding: shared workspaces, custom GPTs, files, folders
• Screen capture and screen recording
• Canvas for building and running generated workflows
• Probably more I'm forgetting...

None of that is in those open weights models. So while it’s a fine move, it doesn’t mean individuals or companies can simply swap it in and have the full ChatGPT experience on their own infrastructure.

The internet has been on fire over reports that LLM-based AI agents are easy to "trick" by feeding them nefarious instructions or hidden prompts. People are saying, "This is why LLM-based agents will never work!" But I don't get why this is a big deal. Just treat them like any other human worker (same guardrails, etc.) and what's the problem?

This is what I propose in this week's blog post: https://lnkd.in/ggFD6Ha2

What happens when AI agents score 100% in computing using benchmarks?

AI-powered computer using agents (CUAs) are getting better every week. They can already complete 45% desktop of tasks in a common benchmark (up from 17% at the beginning of the year).

So what happens when they hit 100%?

CUAs become the universal API for legacy desktop workspaces & apps.

To understand the true impact, I look at what these benchmarks actually measure, what happens when these agents get really good, how human knowledge workers will interact with them, and how IT can manage and secure it all.

AI agents will use the same desktops, apps, and browsers as human workers!

The most transformational use of AI in the enterprise will NOT come from copilots or new AI-powered tools. It will come from AI agents doing actual work—logging in, reading the screen, sending keystrokes and mouse movements—using the same desktops, apps, and browsers as your knowledge workers.

This won’t be a party trick or a hack. It’s the most practical, secure, and scalable way for AI to enter your enterprise.

Think this is inefficient, lame, too much overhead, and/or temporary? Think again! This is the way. I explain fully in this week's blog post: https://lnkd.in/dJSNkb2f

Biggest misconception about AI's impact to the workspace: limiting thinking about AI to the context of automating today’s tasks within today’s organizational structures. The future of work is NOT just us humans doing the same things while AI increasingly handles the repetitive bits.

But for that "AI transformation" (sorry!) to take place, existing workflows, processes, and org structures will need to transform as well.

This. Will. Take. Time.

This is why I'm not super worried about AI barging into the knowledge worker space and changing everything overnight. Enterprises move slowly, and there are a lot of pieces which will have to realign. The good news is our existing ways of thinking about the workspace, (how we manage workers, existing apps, data, and flows), won't change too fast. We have time to get this right.

BTW there's a fun parallel to this in the 100-year-old story about the electrification of factories, which I dig into in this week's blog post: https://lnkd.in/gVXgrwu3

The Information is reporting that OpenAI is quietly designing a new kind of office productivity suite, e.g. a clean sheet version of MS Office or Google Workspace built from the ground up around human-AI collaboration and workflows.

I hadn’t thought of this before, but this is very cool. I use Google Workspace on a daily basis and I love how it was designed for the internet / SaaS era, e.g. it’s not about “files” per se but like every element of everything is in some cosmic database which makes it much easier to track comments, changes, embed always up-to-date slides from one deck into another, etc.

So what’s the next leap of “Office” for AI native?

A love the idea of a “doc” being a continuously evolving canvas, coauthored in real time by humans and AI. It could capture conversations, citations, etc., and becomes less about what is written, but more like what’s requested, what changed, what’s the point of this collab, etc.?

Then I assume it feeds into multiple different UIs and surfaces as needed. Not so much of a structure with a TOC but an interface you can work with, chat about, etc. (Maybe like each doc is a NotebookLM space?)

I dunno.. just random Friday thoughts, but I feel like stuff like this will be pretty great. I wish I had a way to more fully share what I work on in ChatGPT and Gemini with coworkers and let them contribute too.

This is most important foundational AI article I've ever written: The 7-stage roadmap for human-AI collaboration in the workplace.

I created this roadmap to frame conversations about how human workers will use and collaborate with AI in the workspace, and how that interaction with change and evolve over time:

Stage 1: Simple tasks, “prompt and paste” (2023)
Stage 2: Deeper thinking, true collaboration (2024-2025)
Stage 3: The AI watches your screen (2H 2025)
Stage 4: The AI uses your computer for you (2026)
Stage 5: AI uses your computer without you watching it (2026+)
Stage 6: Multi-agent AI communication (2027?+)
Stage 7: AI-orchestrated work (2028?+)

Everything we do at Citrix, and everything you'll do as a leader managing your digital workspace, will happen against this backdrop.

Nothing here is about building custom LLMs or launching moonshot AI initiatives (both of which are fine, but not necessary and not the point). Instead, this post outlines a clear view of how knowledge work is being done, how workers and agents interact, and how the dynamic will shift over time.

Your priority today is to design for disposability, as the tools, agents, and orchestrations you implement today will be obsolete in 18 months. AI-human collaboration will press forward (messily!) through technical fragility, organizational friction, and constant reinvention. Your orchestration framework and control plane will matter more (and be a bigger investment) than the agents themselves.

This is what we think about at Citrix.

Everyone's talking about Mary Meeker's recent 340-page AI Trends report, but no one's talking about how these trends will play out with knowledge workers, EUC, and the workplace. I read it through that lens and looked at how a few AI trends she called out will impact our world, including:

• AI agents are here → They need a place to live.
• Inference is cheap → Shadow AI is exploding.
• The best model doesn’t matter → But the best environment does.
• The agent is the new app → Most enterprises are not ready.

Taken together, it's clear that to "win" ("succeed?", "not fail?") at AI in the workplace, you don't need a roadmap, you need a place for it to operate. If you've built a secure workspace strategy, you're more ready than you think. 

I unpack all this in this week's blog post:

• Workspace-as-a-control-plane
• Execution layer for AI tools & agents
• How we're thinking about this at Citrix

What should you do if you're responsible for EUC but your company leadership hasn't shared a vision for how you should embrace AI use by your employees? That's what I explore in this week's blog post.

Luckily this post is not about "The sky is falling! You're behind!", but actually more like, "Hey, you might just be ok with what you're doing today, even if your leadership isn't providing guidance." 🥳

Like the consumerization of IT / shadow IT of the past, your workers are using AI tools whether your company acknowledges it or not. But if you're managing your workspace properly (whether it's Windows desktops, VDI, DaaS, enterprise browsers, etc.), the good news is you're probably already doing the right things and more ready than you might think.

Your CEO just sent the company-wide "We're now AI-first" memo. Now what?

When this memo drops, everyone scrambles to figure out what exactly it means and what they need to do. But trying to figure out "where to apply AI", or "what's our AI strategy?" is the wrong question.

The right question is, "What will we do when the things we value in the current system change?"

By "things we value", I mean time spent, complexity, human exclusivity, etc. Becoming AI-forward is not about adopting new tools or work streams. It's about reassessing what's worth doing, what's worth rewarding, and what's worth rethinking. (In every department, at every level of the org.)

Of course you also need to keep control of your business operations while this transformation is happening. There's a lot to unpack, but luckily everyone is on the same journey so there's a lot of guidance and frameworks for thinking it through.

That's what I explore in this post: https://lnkd.in/gDqdb2UJ

What does the "workspace" mean in 2025? I know... I KNOW!! Right?? "Another vendor blog about what is a workspace." 😴🙄 Barf! 🤢🤮

Even though the desktop has dissolved, we've still traditionally thought of the workspace as a "thing" that exists (just in different forms: desktop, browser, mobile, etc.) But thinking of the workspace as a noun doesn't help with the hard questions of today:

• How do we secure something that doesn’t really live anywhere anymore?
• How do we manage it when it’s everywhere and nowhere at the same time?
• How do we control access if everything is now a service instead of a thing?

The modern workspace is a fungible abstraction of a location where work can happen. It's instantiated via devices and techniques we're well aware of: a VDI desktop, a MacBook with Chrome, a mobile app, a browser tab. It’s in any and all and none of these at the same time. But those tangible representations of a workspace are just that—instantiated representations of the workspace—not the workspace itself!

So what is a workspace? Sure, its ingredients are apps & data, identity, security, context... And anywhere and time those converge, the potential is there. The workspace is a dynamic control plane, ready to do work, but idle. 

The moment a worker connects—bringing their knowledge, intent, and agency—is when the workspace becomes real. (It’s alive!)

This perspective shift matters because very soon, the notion of a worker is going to change drastically. While it's traditionally been human, soon it will be human, machine, or a combination of both. Organizations need to figure out how to manage, control, and enable this, which requires this mental model shift.

The reward for making this shift is you'll be ready to support all types of work regardless of the worker. Because in 2025 and beyond, work no longer lives in a fixed location or even on a collections of devices—it emerges dynamically, wherever a worker connects to a workspace.

Shopify CEO Tobias Lütke's leaked internal memo is brutal—and brilliant! It reads like a manifesto for what modern work will be.

It's a candid breakdown of how digital friction (meetings, messages, tools) quietly kills productivity, and how most modern "collaboration" environments have become performative instead of effective.

(Tobi reposted it on X once it went viral, so I feel ok discussing and linking it here.)

My highlights:

• Meetings, Slack, noise... all these tools are friction and silent productivity killers.
• AI will enter the workplace from the bottom up, via individual workers slicing through that noise to get more done.
• Shopify's CEO is saying the quiet part out loud: the modern workplace is over-instrumented and under effective. Our challenge isn't more tools, it's smarter environments that amplify the worker doing the work.
• This memo is a call to prepare for AI-augmented workers. Not someday. Now. Human workers are already experimenting. The organizations who win will be the ones who balance speed and control. (Productivity without chaos.)

The memo is bold, but not unique. Every exec I talk to is wrestling with this. Too many apps, too much noise, not enough time to think. What if the next productivity breakthrough isn't about people doing more, but about digital workers doing more of the boring stuff for us?

The companies who get this right won't be the ones with the most tools, they'll be the ones with the least friction.

Your workers didn't wait for your permission before bringing AI into your org. Now what do you do about it?

I just wrote a blog post focusing on what's *really* happening with AI in the enterprise:

• AI didn't wait, your workers are already using it.
• They don't care about the things you care about.
• Today's AI is a passive assistant, but it will quickly evolve to a more active participant in worker-created automations & workflows.
• Soon every worker will have created many of these, and IT departments will need to deal with thousands of new apps, created by an accidental army of citizen developers.
• The company can't block this, we need to figure out how to support the workers while protecting the business.
• Luckily we can use the same guardrails we already have in place for human workers.
• Things are about to get really wild!

I just wrote my first post from my new blogging home on the official Citrix site. I'll be writing weekly about the future of work, AI in the workplace, the evolution of Citrix, and what I'm seeing in the industry and the inside Citrix.

Today's first post is a Hello World and my initial reflections on life at Citrix six weeks in. My quick takes:

• Citrix is more than VDI & DaaS. The "modern worker" use case (like me) with an unmanaged BYO laptop + Citrix Enterprise Browser + Citrix Workspace + Citrix Secure Private Access (SPA) is a huge. (No VDI for me!) It really has the potential for orders of magnitude more users than Citrix Virtual Apps & Desktops. (v.interesting future here too when you think about eLux, deviceTRUST, Chrome Enterprise Premium...)

• The conversations around how AI will *really* enter the workplace (via workers from the bottom-up, not top-down from corporate IT) and the upcoming changes to knowledge work and workers are super fascinating. There's more energy here than I've felt in my entire career, conversations within Citrix are refreshingly electric, and things are moving fast. (Many more posts on this soon...)

• Actually the whole vibe at Citrix is pretty great right now. I know the company went through major changes over the past few years and hasn't been super public about their plans, vision, and viewpoint on the future. But that's changing (Exhibit A: my blog).
