This is a list of LinkedIn posts (actual "posts", not "articles") that I, Brian Madden, VP Technology Officer & Futurist at Citrix have posted to LinkedIn. This list is only "standalone" posts, e.g. ones that are not reposts and that do not link to blog posts, speeches, etc.

My core thesis for the future of EUC (from the EUC Forum Winter Meeting 2024 in London):

1. AI Agents will be the new knowledge workers.
2. They will use Windows desktops.
3. Those desktops will be remoted.
4. This model will last longer than we think.

Is Microsoft Copilot Vision the next version of Microsoft Recall?

No!

In fact they're two separate products with separate use cases.

(Following up a response I wrote about the latest episode of The Artificial Intelligence Podcast from Paul Roetzer and Mike Kaput ...)

Microsoft Recall is the "record everything I do on my computer via screenshots every few seconds" feature of Windows 11 that creeped everyone out a few months ago, and that Microsoft had to pause to fix security and defaults. It's now available again, and tied to Windows 11 + Copilot PCs.

Microsoft Copilot Vision is a separate product. For now it only works in the Edge browser, only for preapproved websites, and only when it's specifically invoked. Also, crucially, Vision does NOT create an archive of everything that's been seen in the browser. It only wakes up to view the screen when invoked, and it forgets/deletes what it saw when the chat ends.

So, these are two different products with different use cases.

Vision lets users have ephemeral chats about content in the browser with a cloud-based LLM/LVM. Recall is a screenshot archiving tool, with an AI-powered search capability that runs on device.

Over time I expect these capabilities will evolve and merge, and in the future every worker will have some kind of AI watching their screen and "assisting" them. But for now, they are both just very early previews of two very different products.

The internet is on fire discussing that Goldman Sachs report that Gen AI is not generating ROI and might not for another ten years. But here's the thing: You have employees who are using AI-powered tools in your workplace TODAY, regardless of what some investment bankers think about the macroeconomic ROI over the next decade. The impact to your workplace of what your employees are doing on their own today is real, and you need to understand this and decide how you want to support it.

The more I read from AI vendors, the more I realize these are NOT like traditional enterprise software vendors at all. While there's an element of that which is fun and exciting, it's also pretty scary when you realize that the people running these companies are way more focused on creating Artificial Super Intelligence than they are with boring corporate things like safety and compliance. So what does that mean for your workplace, in a world where your employees have direct access to these tools created with this mindset?

Remember that story about Wells Fargo firing some employees for faking keyboard activity? It perfectly highlights the increasing complexity between actual work and perceived productivity in our current world of workplace AI and employee-driven automation. In this article, I explore the broader implications for employee oversight and workplace ethics in this new environment, and implore businesses of all size to reconsider what they measure and reward.

The Gartner Hype Cycle for AI 2024 is out. Something like $20 TRILLION in combined market cap for tech companies doing AI, over $200 BILLION in direct investments in AI companies, and all we have to show for it on the plateau of productivity is freakin' computer vision?!? 🤦‍♂️

Everyone's buzzing about Apple Intelligence. In this article, I look at it through the lens of corporate IT. What are the risks of lots of employees using it on their Apple devices? Personally I'm not worried about the security or privacy issues. The bigger issue is personalized, fast, and well-integrated generative AI which transforms how employees generate work product (whether Office Copilot, Apple Intelligence, Google...), when scaled across a whole company will make things very weird, very fast. The "BYOD" consumerization of IT issues of the 2010s are child's play compared to what businesses need to think about ASAP.

In my Microsoft Recall article, I wrote that AI-powered screen recorders would be "the future", and become common at work. Imagine how powerful that would be with today's VDI/DaaS desktops: you already have the screen display pipeline streaming from the cloud, what a great way to plug-in some AI-powered compliance, DEX, and workforce analytics engines!

I was wrong! In my article last week where I analyzed the potential future impact of Microsoft's newly-announced Windows Recall feature (AI-powered screen recording), I wrote that the security fears were overblown since the repository was local and encrypted.

Gabe Knuth initially commented that I might be glossing over some potential issues, and then yesterday, Kevin Beaumont wrote an in-depth analysis "Stealing everything you’ve ever typed or viewed on your own Windows PC is now possible with two lines of code — inside the Copilot+ Recall disaster."

I've updated my article appropriately. The core of the article remains true—it was more about the longer term evolution of Recall-like technologies for the future of employer/employee relationships and workplace AI, but I was way off on my casual dismissal of the potential security risks of Recall as it works today.

My deep-dive analysis of the Microsoft Recall "AI screen recorder" feature. Security concerns are overblown, but also miss the point. Tools like Microsoft Recall are coming (whether we want them or not), and they are the future of the AI-powered workplace. It's going to be a wild ride, and we should all start thinking about the implications and how we want to embrace things now.

Alessandro Perilli has just released, for free, the entire Year 1 archive (49 issues, Feb 2023 - Feb 2024) of his subscription-only AI newsletter called "Synthetic Work". Probably 1,000 pages total. His newsletter is FANTASTIC, literally the only "must read" resource which I look forward to each week.

He reminds me of what I did at BrianMadden.com back in the day: No BS, vendor neutral, extremely accessible (you don't need to be an AI expert), witty, an just enough typos to know it's written by an actual human.

Synthetic Work is written for normal people who want to understand the impact that AI will have on the workplace. When I joined ILKI to build our Workplace AI practice, I spent two months catching up through the archive. It's a big part of my foundation AI way of thinking.

You need to subscribe to get the newsletters from Feb 2024 onward, but it's something like 10 bucks a month. Cheap enough to not think about, and I promise you will not be disappointed.

In light of the various "AI PC" and "Copilot+ PC" hysteria, it's time for the 2024 edition of "Yes, the enterprise desktop is important," but "No, not because of AI or Windows apps." TLDR: The enterprise desktop is going to be a thing for a long time, whether you like it or not. 🤷‍♂️

I went to the World AI Cannes Festival #WAICF last week (along with ILKI CTO Adrien Huerre) looking for concrete ways companies could use AI and Gen AI in the office today. I heard plenty of hype, but not much practical advice. Similar to past tech waves like VDI, Cloud, Enterprise Mobility, and the Consumerzation of IT, it looks like the hype is a couple of steps ahead of the reality today.
