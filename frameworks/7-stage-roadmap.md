# The 7-stage roadmap for human-AI collaboration

Brian's most comprehensive framework for understanding how AI enters knowledge work. Each stage builds on the previous.

*Published: June 24, 2025 — [Original post](https://www.citrix.com/blogs/2025/06/24/the-7-stage-roadmap-for-human-ai-collaboration-in-the-workplace/)*

## The stages

**Stage 1: Simple tasks, "prompt and paste" (2023)**
Workers use AI for one-and-done tasks: summarizing, drafting emails, translating. They type a prompt, get output, copy it into their real workflow. Low-effort, low-stakes experimentation.

**Stage 2: Deeper thinking, true collaboration (2024–2025)**
AI becomes a strategic thinking partner. Workers upload document stacks, engage in multi-turn discussions, develop strategy documents, analyze data. This is real work, not throwaway tasks. Workers bifurcate into "AI superhumans" and "workers who might get left behind."

**Stage 3: The AI watches your screen (2H 2025)**
AI gains ambient awareness of what's on a worker's screen via tools like Microsoft Copilot Vision or Google Gemini in Chrome. The shift from reactive to ambient. Serious privacy and trust concerns emerge.

**Stage 4: The AI uses your computer for you (2026)**
Computer-using agents (CUAs) operate the mouse and keyboard, navigating GUIs like a human would. Humans still provide scaffolding; AI fills in the gaps.

**Stage 5: AI uses your computer without you watching (2026+)**
Trust improves, workers let agents run independently. Agents get their own login identities. The mental shift: assign tasks to a workspace, not a person.

**Stage 6: Multi-agent AI communication (2027?+)**
Multiple AI agents coordinate, with one agent kicking off another, handling subtasks, returning results. Workers shift from doers to orchestrators.

**Stage 7: AI-orchestrated work (2028?+)**
AI orchestrates large-scale workflows across people, agents, and systems. Humans provide strategy, governance, and goal-setting. Any UIs needed by humans are generated by AI in whatever form makes sense.

## How to use this framework

The specific timing will vary, but the trajectory is clear. Most workers are in Stage 2 and experimenting with Stage 3. The top 0.1% are already pushing into Stages 4-5.

The priority is structural readiness—designing for disposability, since tools/agents/orchestrations implemented today will be obsolete in 18 months. Don't build for Stage 7. Build infrastructure flexible enough to handle whatever comes next.

## The self-correction

Brian publicly corrected this framework in February 2026. The roadmap describes evolution *within* the existing model of work. But second brains and personal AI knowledge systems suggest the model itself is dissolving. The top practitioners aren't progressing through stages—they're working in a fundamentally different way. The 7-stage roadmap isn't wrong. It's incomplete. It describes the visible 20%. The frontier work is in the invisible 80%.
