# Subscribable brains

Experts should stop publishing content and start publishing their structured knowledge repos—which subscribers integrate into their own AI systems.

*Published: February 17, 2026 — [Original post](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/hey-creators-stop-publishing-content-start-your-second-brian-madden-ca0ae)*

## The problem

The creator economy is collapsing under AI-generated slop. Human creators can't compete with infinite AI content by producing *more* content. Doubling down on production is unsustainable.

But people don't just want to watch experts. They want to integrate experts into their own thinking infrastructure.

## The model

A subscribable brain is a structured knowledge repo (markdown files in a git repository) that an expert maintains as part of their daily work. Subscribers sync via git and MCP and integrate the expert's knowledge into their own AI systems.

The creator's maintenance of their own second brain *is* the product. Zero incremental production effort. The work they do for themselves is also the product they ship.

## The economics

- Newsletter: $10--20/month (content you read and forget)
- Subscribable brain: ~$100/month (knowledge infrastructure that compounds inside your system)
- Consulting engagement: $25,000+ (direct access to the expert's judgment)

A subscribable brain sits between newsletter and analyst subscription in value, but with fundamentally better delivery. It's not content. It's infrastructure that compounds.

## The technical stack

Everything needed already exists:
- **GitHub repos:** hosting and distribution
- **Git:** version control and sync
- **MCP:** AI-to-AI knowledge integration
- **GitHub Sponsors:** payment

No platform to build. No middleware. No startup required.

## Enterprise implications

- **Consulting firms:** Junior consultants carry senior partners' accumulated knowledge—every framework, every past engagement's lessons learned, every hard-won pattern recognition, available in real time
- **Retiring executives:** Institutional wisdom compounds in the organization after they leave, not walking out the door
- **Corporate modules:** Brand strategy, messaging guidelines, corporate positioning—wired into every employee's AI so it actually gets followed, not filed

## Subscribable facets

Not just whole brains—individual modules:
- An author's voice
- A strategist's frameworks
- A designer's principles
- A subject matter expert's domain knowledge

Actor likeness analogy for the written word. Your expertise, licensed and integrated into other people's AI systems.

## The meta

This repo—brianmadden.ai—is a proof of concept for the subscribable brain model.
