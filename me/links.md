# What I read & listen to

If you want to understand and learn about the impact and use of AI in the business world, these are the people and resources I follow.

I have no affiliation with any of the things listed here (except my own blog), everything here is what I personally read and listen to.

## If you only do one thing

Listen to [The Artificial Intelligence Show](https://www.marketingaiinstitute.com/podcast-showcase) podcast, about one hour, every week. Seriously, do this and nothing else and you will be smarter about AI in business in a few weeks. If you're just getting started, go back and listen to past episodes.

They also have a free monthly [Intro to AI zoom webinar](https://www.marketingaiinstitute.com/intro-to-ai). Definitely sign up for that if you're just getting started.

They also have a free weekly newsletter ([ExecAI Insider Weekly](https://smarterx.ai)).
