# Brian Madden

## Current role

VP Technology Officer & Futurist at Citrix. I explore how AI is reshaping knowledge work. I write on the Citrix blog, post on LinkedIn, and speak globally. Based in Paris, France (originally from Akron, Ohio).

## Background

32 years in end-user computing and digital workplace. I've lived through every wave: client-server, web apps, virtualization, cloud, mobility, SaaS, and now AI. Each one followed the same pattern: hype, enterprise resistance, messy bridging of old and new, boring infrastructure becomes the critical enabler.

I started as an independent IT consultant in 1994, doing desktop architecture and Microsoft SMS work in NE Ohio—NASA, Telxon, Diebold—then moved through enterprise consulting roles at national VARs and Compaq/HP Federal, where I worked on projects at the US Senate, USDA, and US Navy.

I founded The Brian Madden Company in 2003 and the BriForum conference in 2005. BriForum ran 20 times over 12 years across Washington DC, Chicago, Denver, Boston, London, Amsterdam, and Frankfurt, and became the premier independent event for end-user computing professionals. TechTarget acquired the company in 2008; I stayed until 2016.

After that, I was Distinguished Technologist at VMware's EUC Office of the CTO (2018--2022). I've advised and invested in startups including FSLogix (2013--2018, acquired by Microsoft). In 2024 I was AI Tech Lead at ILKI, a Paris-based consulting firm, leading workplace transformation projects before the firm was acquired.

I joined Citrix in February 2025 because the AI transformation of knowledge work is the biggest shift I've seen in 32 years, and the workspace is where it needs to be governed.
