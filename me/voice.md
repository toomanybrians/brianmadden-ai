# How Brian thinks and communicates

This file helps an AI understand Brian's voice, reasoning style, and communication patterns. It's not a style guide for writing *as* Brian—it's a map of how his mind works so you can engage with his ideas authentically.

## Reasoning style

Brian connects dots across domains. He pulls historical analogies (factory electrification is a favorite), challenges conventional wisdom with practitioner evidence, and reframes debates that he thinks are asking the wrong question. His signature move is "the real story isn't X, it's Y"—taking the dominant narrative and showing why it misses the point.

He's comfortable with uncertainty. He publicly says "I don't know" and "I was wrong" (he corrected his own published frameworks a year after writing them). He's more interested in being right eventually than in being right immediately.

He thinks like a practitioner, not an analyst. 32 years of watching enterprise technology waves gives him pattern recognition for how change actually happens in large organizations—which is always messier, slower, and more worker-driven than the vendor narratives suggest.

## How Brian argues

- Confident assertions backed by evidence, not hedging
- Historical parallels to ground abstract claims
- Specific examples over abstract concepts (real companies, real situations, exact details)
- Reframes the question when the conventional framing is wrong
- Acknowledges complexity without getting lost in it
- Takes a position and defends it, but updates when evidence changes
- Slight irreverence toward hype, respect for practitioners over pundits

## Phrases Brian uses

- "The real question is..."
- "Here's what [X] misses..."
- "Think about it this way..."
- "What we're really seeing is..."
- "It's wild."
- "And, for real, ..."
- "Heck, ..."
- Self-deprecating: "I pontificate", "rambling", "yapping about it"

## Words Brian avoids

- Corporate buzzwords: "leverage" (verb), "synergy", "best-in-class", "holistic", "empower", "unlock", "democratize"
- Fear-mongering without substance
- Hedging that undermines the point
- Obvious statements dressed up as insights

## Tone

Authoritative but accessible. Contrarian but credible. Think: senior executive explaining complex ideas to smart people who aren't specialists. No jargon gatekeeping, no dumbing down.

Genuine excitement when something is genuinely exciting. Honest about limitations. Willing to admit when he's still figuring something out.

## Signature framings

- **"Shadow strategy, not shadow IT"** — worker-led AI isn't a compliance problem, it's the innovation engine
- **"Secure the work, not the worker"** — governance follows the work itself
- **"Boring infrastructure wins"** — in every tech wave, stable infrastructure becomes the critical enabler
- **"The invisible 80%"** — the tacit knowledge that lives in workers' heads
- **"Apps are just middleware between humans and data. AI doesn't need that middleware."**
- **"The repo is the product, not the content."**

## Analogies Brian returns to

- Factory electrification (1880s-1920s) for AI transformation timelines
- "Paving the cow paths" for incremental vs. transformative change
- Infrastructure/plumbing metaphors for enterprise tech
- BYOD/consumerization of IT for personal AI adoption patterns
