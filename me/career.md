# Who is this guy?

Brian has spent 32 years at the intersection of end-user computing and enterprise technology. The through-line: how do real workers actually use technology, and how do enterprises govern that reality without killing what makes it useful?

This file is the chronological version of that story.

## Early career (1994—2003)

Brian was an IT consultant in the Akron/Cleveland, Ohio area, and then the Washington DC area, from about 1994 to 2003. During this time he was variously an independent consultant, worked for Vanstar (acquired by Inacom), and Compaq (acquired by HP). He mostly focused on Microsoft desktop and desktop management technologies—building, imaging, and deploying Windows NT workstations, security and Active Directory policy, Microsoft Systems Management Server, and so on.

He first encountered Citrix in 1996—WinFrame 1.6 on CUBIX blades—but it became a career focus in 1998 when Microsoft announced they were creating their own "version of Citrix" (which became Terminal Server). That made Citrix pretty mainstream. Brian was at Vanstar and decided that Citrix technology would be good for the company, so he set up the local Cleveland Vanstar office as a Citrix Silver Partner and ran a local seminar in August 1998 to talk about Citrix and thin client computing. This was his first ever public speech.

From there, he continued to focus on Citrix technologies and was prolific on the THIN list (the main Citrix mailing list at the time). In 2001, he decided to write a book about Citrix MetaFrame because there wasn't a hands-on, practical guide to actually designing and architecting Citrix systems. (Everything else out there was either a rehash of the product docs or certification study guide.)

That became is first book, *Citrix MetaFrame XP: Advanced Technical Design Guide*, over 700 pages. He published it himself (using BrianMadden.com Publishing as the imprint). This was before the age of blogs and heavy tech web content, so books still mattered. It reached an Amazon.com sales rank of #31 (that's from ALL books, not just IT books) and sold extremely well overall. He followed quickly with an expanded second edition (now 800 pages). Both editions together sold 60,000 copies.

## The Brian Madden Company & BrianMadden.com (2003—2016)

Based on the success of those books, Brian was getting more independent consulting requests, so he left HP in 2003 to go independent. At the same time he started blogging on BrianMadden.com. This was so early that he actually had to write his own blog engine. (ASP / VBScript 3 with an ODBD connection to an Access database!!) Over time, BrianMadden.com became the top site globally for news, analysis, conversation, and discourse in the Citrix, thin client computing, and end-user computing industry, with almost .

Brian flipped the traditional analyst model: all research and insight was free for everyone. In 2004, he launched the BrianMadden Masterclass for Citrix experts and the BrianMadden Live podcast. In 2005, he launched BriForum. In 2006, he launched training DVDs. His company grew over time, including well-known EUC analysts Gabe Knuth and Jack Madden (his brother).

By the numbers: 2,500+ original articles and thought pieces (from 50+ industry experts), 1,000+ videos, 6 books, 120 podcast episodes.

TechTarget (now Informa TechTarget) acquired the Brian Madden Company, including BrianMadden.com and BriForum, in November 2008. Brian stayed at TechTarget through late 2016, running the BriForum conferences and writing on BrianMadden.com until then.

## BriForum conference (2005—2016)

Founded by Brian, BriForum was the premier independent conference for end-user computing professionals. The name was a play on Citrix's "iForum" conference, as this was "Brian's iForum", an independent, vendor-neutral, and highly technical & practical (not vendor marketing) conference. We held 20 BriForums over 12 years in Washington DC, Chicago, Denver, Boston, London, Amsterdam, and Frankfurt. Typical event: 3 days, 500 attendees, 40 speakers, 60 breakout sessions, 30 exhibit hall vendors. So it was pretty legit albeit a pretty niche topic. Maybe companies in our industry came out of BriForum as experts met there. BriForum was known for practitioner-focused content, vendor independence, and direct technical depth. It was acquired by TechTarget in 2008.

## BrianMadden.com Publishing (2001—2014)

Boutique IT book and DVD publisher. Brian's books were primarily on end-user computing technologies. The through-line: how enterprises deliver and govern the worker experience. BrianMadden.com Publishing also published additional titles by other authors—about 20 products total on Citrix, VMware, Microsoft, enterprise mobility, and thin client computing.

## Why the history matters

Brian has watched every enterprise technology wave follow the same pattern: vendor hype → enterprise resistance → workers adopting the consumer version anyway → IT eventually providing a governed version. He saw it with client-server, web apps, virtualization, cloud, mobile/BYOD, and SaaS. AI is following the same pattern, but faster and with higher stakes.

The 32 years of pattern recognition is what makes the current analysis credible. When Brian says "boring infrastructure wins" or "worker-led adoption always outpaces corporate initiatives," he's not theorizing—he's describing what he's watched happen six times.
