# 🧠 Brian's feed

Short-form thoughts, observations, and things I'd tweet if that were still a thing. No AI. No algorithm. No engagement metrics. No 280-character limit. Just markdown and `git push`. 🎩

**Subscribe:** Watch this file on GitHub, or `git pull` and diff. Every entry has an anchor link — click any heading to get a permalink.

**What this is:** The repo is the product, not the content. If Twitter were invented today, it'd be a markdown file in a git repo. This is that. A finer person's twitter. 🫖
