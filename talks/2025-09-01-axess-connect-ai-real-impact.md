# Axess Connect — Artificial intelligence, real impact: Brian Madden talks AI in the modern workplace

## Episode details

**Context:** Part 2 of Brian's Axess Connect appearance, continuing from the July episode. Zeroes in on what AI means for day-to-day work: productivity definitions, job compression, career progression disruption, build vs. buy decisions, and practical advice. Contains early precursors to the second brain approach—the "advisory council" GPT project and "Bizarro Brian" contrarian GPT. Closes with a 12-18 month prediction for computer-using agents in VDI environments.

**Key arguments made:**

- Productivity is a loaded word—more work? better quality? less time? It depends on the task, the person, the situation
- AI implementation is bigger than IT—HR, legal, compliance, executive leadership all need to be at the table
- Job compression: if AI takes the easy tasks, workers are left with only hard tasks all day. Humans need cognitive breaks.
- Career progression disruption: AI does entry-level work, pushing humans up the delegation chain. As AI improves, what you tell it evolves from micro-managing clicks to strategic requests.
- "I think I do the work of what a team of three or four people would have done five years ago"—individual contributor amplification
- Advisory council concept: collecting thought leaders' writings into a GPT project and brainstorming against them. Early precursor to the second brain.
- Bizarro Brian: contrarian custom GPT for gut-checking work. "What am I missing? Give me a contrarian viewpoint."
- Build vs. buy: "If you spend three months building something, it might just be an inbox feature in v.next"
- Networks of specialized small models will outperform general models in specific domains
- Interface evolution: text in/text out is DOS. Voice, vision, screen, gestures—whatever UI you want will exist.
- AI as great equalizer: "the world's best coach that billionaires with personal staffs can have already. Now we can all get that."
- Computer-using agent benchmarks at ~45% (July 2025), up from 6% previous summer, 17% start of year. Humans at 72-74%.
- 12-18 month prediction: agent IDs in Entra ID, AI agents logging into corporate VDI workspaces, performing tasks without supervision, using A2A to coordinate

**Notable:** Contains early precursors to the BMAD second brain—the "advisory council" GPT (persistent thought leader context) and "Bizarro Brian" (contrarian GPT). Both concepts evolved into the full markdown-based second brain system.

## Transcript

[Intro recapping Part 1. Part 2 focuses on AI as co-worker inside existing systems, virtual desktops and guardrails, and what it feels like when AI is another member of the team.]

**On productivity as a loaded word:**

Productivity means different things to different people. Is it producing more work? Same amount but better quality? Same amount with less time? This is not a decision every company needs to make once—it might be different for every task and every project and every person.

The bigger point: when you start to implement AI, the conversation has to be larger than just IT. Executive leadership, HR, legal, compliance. From an HR standpoint, think about what this is doing to employees. If your job was half easy and half difficult—AI does all the easy tasks. So now my job is only the hard tasks? You can't just take away all the easy, relaxing stuff and jam every day full of difficult things.

**On career progression disruption:**

AI does the easy jobs—but that's someone's entry-level position. As AI gets better, the tasks it can do keep getting more and more. It's like we're progressing in our careers—task worker to junior manager to senior manager to director. As you go higher, less task managing, more broad business concepts.

As AI gets more capable, what you tell it evolves too. Before: "go to LinkedIn, open a browser, click here, click here." Now: "check this on LinkedIn." Future: "how is my social post doing?" and it knows that means LinkedIn.

**On individual contributor amplification:**

I'm an individual contributor at Citrix. I think I do the work of what a team of three or four people would have done five years ago. Some high brain activities, some low brain. I'm just doing a lot more. That's leading to more conversations, more directions we wouldn't have gone otherwise, which might end up hiring more people for new things.

**On the advisory council and Bizarro Brian:**

I pull all the blogs I follow into ChatGPT. I've got custom projects set up. I can ask my advisory council—they don't even know they're on it. I put myself in there too. All the blogs that connect with me, I take the post and copy it into this GPT project. Building the library of things I think are good. Then I ask questions against that library. Not "was this answered in the library?" More like "here's the people and ideas I find interesting—how might they think about this thing over here?" Very powerful. Available to every single person.

I also created Bizarro Brian. Bizarro Superman—the opposite. Anything I drop in, think critically. Am I blind spots? What am I missing? Contrarian viewpoint. I write the blog post and just drop it in there. I don't have ChatGPT write my blogs, but I brainstorm to make sure I'm thinking of all angles.

**On build vs. buy:**

If you spend three months building something, it might just be an inbox feature in v.next. Bloomberg spent $10 million building a custom GPT with their data, then the next version of ChatGPT just did everything they had for free. Don't build for builder's sake. But if building excites you—100% do it. Approach AI in the way most interesting to you.

**On networks of small models:**

Not every model needs to try for general intelligence. A small model trained only on doctor data can score higher than ChatGPT on medical exams. Runs on a Raspberry Pi. Networks of lots of little models all talking to each other—that's going to be really big.

**On interface evolution:**

We're not going to access these models via text as the only interface. That's like saying when home computers first came out. Voice, vision, screen, buds—whatever UI you want will exist. Don't think of these models as just text in and text out.

**On AI as the great equalizer:**

It's like the world's best coach, assistant, helper that billionaires with personal staffs can have already. The CEO has a chief of staff who prepares everything. But now we can all get that, allowing us to do our best work in the way that's most fulfilling.

**On the 12-18 month prediction:**

Computer-using agent benchmarks at about 45% today. Humans at 72-74%. Beginning of year was 17%. Last summer was 6%. Within 12 to 18 months, 100%. Doesn't mean AI takes your job—means AI can do everything it needs to within a desktop.

Agent IDs in Entra ID. AI agents logging into corporate workspaces, performing tasks without supervision, using A2A to talk to other agents. My agent talks to my coworker's agent. Agents on my inbox picking up tasks they can do. Basic level, but I believe very strongly that's in the next 12 to 18 months.
