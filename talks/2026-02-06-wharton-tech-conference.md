# Wharton Tech Conference 2026 - February 6

## Talk details

**Title:** Blueprints That Actually Get Built: How Change Really Happens in the Enterprise

**Abstract:** The best technology rarely wins. I've spent 32 years watching superior products lose to inferior ones, promising initiatives stall, and "transformations" that never quite transform. Why? Because the people building and selling technology systematically misunderstand how change actually happens inside organizations. In this talk, I'll share what I've learned about enterprise adoption (using AI as my primary example, since it's the most dramatic case of these dynamics playing out right now and probably interesting to everyone). The audience will learn why worker-led transformation beats top-down initiatives, what actually determines adoption speed (hint: not the tech), and how to think about your career as the world shifts from "doing the work" to "orchestrating the work." These principles will serve you whether you're building products, implementing change, or leading teams—in AI or whatever comes next.

## Narrative arc (from the transcript as delivered)

The talk uses the **bottleneck framework** as its through-line: every technology wave has a bottleneck, it's never the technology itself, and finding the bottleneck is where value, leverage, and careers concentrate. Three historical examples build the pattern, then AI is shown to have a new kind of bottleneck—the invisible 80% of knowledge work—leading to a personal knowledge system CTA.

### I. Opening: blueprints meet reality (slides 1-4)

- Title slide: "Blueprints That Actually Get Built: How Change Really Happens in the Enterprise"
- Tyson quote: "Everyone has a plan until they get punched in the mouth"
- Framing: in the enterprise, the bottleneck does the punching. Every technology wave has one. It's never where you expect. It determines whether blueprints become reality or stay blueprints.
- "The bottleneck is where the value concentrates. That's where leverage lives. That's where careers are made."
- Brian's intro: futurist at Citrix, 32 years in enterprise tech, paid full-time to think about how AI impacts work. American living in Paris.

### II. The factory electrification story (slides 5-14)

- 1880s factories: centralized steam power, driveshafts, leather belts. Machines arranged by power requirements, not workflow.
- Electricity arrives. They swap steam engines for electric motors. Same layout, same processes. Minimal gain.
- Individual electric motors on each machine. Still same layout. Still marginal.
- The breakthrough: machines are now independent—rearrange them by task order. Birth of the assembly line. Production cheaper, better quality.
- But this wasn't easy. Inventory, storage, building layout, raw materials flow all had to be redesigned.
- Takeaway: new tech plugged into old structures changes nothing. Transformation only happens when you redesign around the bottleneck.
- This took ~50 years. The bottleneck wasn't the motors. It was the workflow design built around the old system.
- Aside during delivery: accidentally hit the "end presentation" button on the clicker mid-talk. Recovered and continued.

### III. The 30-year web migration (slides 15-22)

- 1990s: Windows apps stuck in the office. The web was supposed to kill Windows.
- Web advantages: instant access, any device, anywhere, update once, better security, no data on endpoint.
- The catch: "Just rewrite all your applications from scratch." That's the bottleneck.
- Listed every technology that was going to "kill the old way": Java, Flash, AJAX, Silverlight, HTML5, SaaS, Linux, Chrome, mobile, PWAs, cloud, etc. None did. "AI is going to kill the old way. And I'm like, please."
- This is the factory story again: plug new tech into old constraints, of course it doesn't work.
- **Citrix origin story:** Citrix was born to solve this bottleneck. Allowed enterprises to get web-app advantages with existing Windows apps. They identified the bottleneck—implementation—and bypassed it. Multi-billion dollar company, 37 years later.

### IV. Workers take power / consumerization (slides 23-28)

- 2007: Steve Jobs announces iPhone. "This did not exist. Nothing like this existed." Brian's Blackberry story.
- First time consumer technology was better than enterprise technology.
- Workers bought iPhones, wanted to connect to work. Company response: NO. Not secure, not compliant, not managed.
- Workers didn't care: "I got Gmail on my phone, man."
- Eventually enterprises figured out governance: MDM, containerization, work/personal separation. Showed actual slides from a 2012 talk on this.
- But it took ~5 years (2007-2012) before you could really use an iPhone for work at a big company.
- Same factory story: the tech worked on day one. The bottleneck was the governance that companies needed.

### V. AI: removes all the bottlenecks, right? (slides 29-32)

- Tongue-in-cheek setup: AI should have no bottleneck. Workers don't need IT to rewrite anything. Tools are instantly productive. $20/month ChatGPT = immediate value. Consumerization on steroids. No permission needed.
- "You literally cannot block this. Point the phone camera at your laptop screen and now you have all the data on your phone."
- Everyone's panicking or excited. CEOs have FOMO. "CEO's AI strategy is to not be Blockbuster Video in the Netflix documentary."
- But AI projects are failing. MIT study (debunked but directionally correct). Pointed out: big transformation projects fail anyway, don't need AI to help them fail.
- So where's the bottleneck? The tech works. Governance is hard but we've solved hard problems before. Something different is happening.

### VI. The shift: apps to knowledge / the invisible 80% (slides 33-38)

- Previous changes were about things you can see: motors, devices, apps. AI is about knowledge—invisible, fluid, personal. Lives in people's heads.
- Organizations are massive knowledge machines where the cogs are humans using their knowledge brains. You can only see the outputs.
- The 20% you can see: emails, documents, meeting transcripts, schedules, decisions
- The 80% you can't see: thinking, reasoning, staring out the window, looking at birds. "Sometimes you just need to walk the dog, shower time."
- Severance reference: "Those workers don't have any bird time."
- The bottleneck: consultants and IT only see the 20%. They build solutions for the visible part. Of course those don't work.
- Workers succeed because they have access to their full 100%. That's why $20/month ChatGPT beats million-dollar enterprise AI projects. Not because of the tech—because of access to the invisible 80%.
- "Stop using AI to solve the 20% problem." AI as a tool for emails and summaries is the 20%. That's what most enterprise projects focus on. That's why they fail. Microsoft Copilot example: $30/month to help write emails—"that's a cool feature, it should be free."

### VII. The shift: use AI to solve the 80% problem (slides 39-40)

- Brian's personal story: "For three years, I used AI wrong." Used it as a tool for specific tasks.
- The shift: stopped using AI like a tool, started using it to unlock thinking.
- Built a personal knowledge system using Claude Code with files on his computer. Everything he knows, does, has written, how he thinks—going into it.
- "Now I can query my own knowledge. It is a true knowledge partner. It is my 80%. Now it has a helper."
- Always updating: conversations, notes, calls, everything goes in. Instructions, ideas, story arcs, synthesis, people, to-do lists.
- "This is not an app I created. This is a pattern of usage."
- CTA to the audience: "You can start today. Build your own knowledge system. Just ask your AI: I want to build a personal knowledge system. Take everything you know about me. Let's go."
- Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini—doesn't matter. Start with your own writing and content. It compounds from there.
- "I had the holy shit red pill moment twice in my career. Once when ChatGPT clicked. And again a few weeks ago with this."

### VIII. Close (slides 41-42)

- Factory callback: "They had electricity and motors for 50 years before they found the bottleneck. Once they did, they rearranged the machines. That's what you're going to do—not with machines, but with knowledge."
- "Every company on planet Earth needs to rearrange its machines. But the machines are knowledge workers, knowledge processes."
- Takeaway: "When everything is changing too fast, when everything seems crazy, ask yourself: where's the bottleneck? Position yourself there."

### IX. Contact and close (slides 43-44)

- LinkedIn (only social media Brian uses), corporate blog, bmad.com/links
- Mentioned wanting to open-source his knowledge system on GitHub
- Citrix logo

## Extended Q&A

### Q1: What is Citrix's bottleneck?

- "Same as everyone else's." Every company faces the same fundamental challenge: rethinking how AI fits beyond traditional technology transformation patterns. The bottleneck framework applies universally—the answer is always about redesigning around new capabilities, not just adopting new tools.
- Key detail: "I pay $100 a month for Claude Max. But I cancelled ~$200 worth of other subscriptions. I don't use Excel. I don't use ToDo apps. I don't use Feedly."

### Q2: Why blog / create content in the AI age

- Brian's backstory: ran BrianMadden.com for ~10-20 years, thousands of articles, six books, tech conference, training material. Sold it. Now doing reputation marketing for Citrix.
- Key insight: "I blog for AI, not for people. No one reads anymore." His blog posts feed his knowledge system and become the seed material for his AI brain.
- Vision: publish the knowledge system on GitHub. "Open source brain project." File-by-file, line-by-line attribution. Provenance of ideas. When everyone has knowledge brains, you can forensically trace ideas back to their origin.
- On connecting brains: imagined plugging trusted people's AI brains together. "My wife went to Haas. Imagine her crew can plug in their brains to each other."
- On AI making us dumber: "If you use AI to outsource your thinking, you'll get worse at thinking. If you use AI to outsource your busy work—filing, processing, transcription—you can focus on actual thinking."

### Q3: How do startups differentiate when models are commoditized

- Models are like CPUs. "Intel Inside" used to matter; now you don't buy a laptop for its CPU brand. Same with AI models—they swap out.
- Brian's system is all instructions and files. Can use Gemini today, Claude tomorrow.
- For startups: don't build something a new model release makes obsolete. "Assume AI is very powerful and very smart and all the dumb mistakes are going to not be a thing. Build for what AI is going to do and let the models catch up to you."
- Klarna example: $10M custom system on GPT-3.5, then GPT-4 did everything better on day one.

### Q4: How do you practically build a personal knowledge system

- Don't be afraid of Claude Code if you're not a coder. "It's just a button that says Code. All that means is it can access files on your computer."
- Structure: file folders, Markdown text files. ~80% is knowledge (blogs, transcripts, articles, feeds). ~20% is instructions the system writes for itself.
- Has a readme-first file so any model can orient itself to the system
- Still using many conversations per day (50+), but all in context of the system
- Example feature he built by just telling it: screenshot a podcast on his phone while walking, system finds the podcast, pulls transcript, finds the timestamp, extracts context, files it
- "Dreaming" at night: GitHub Actions run nightly—system scans everything, finds connections, does scenario planning, presents a morning briefing
- Everyone's system will be different. That's the point. "You can't pick up your bar with someone else's laptop."
- Mentioned Nate B. Jones (Seattle, ex-Amazon) and his YouTube video on building a second brain

## Key lines (as delivered)

- "You literally cannot block this."
- "CEO's AI strategy is to not be Blockbuster Video in the Netflix documentary."
- "I can't see transformed knowledge."
- "I blog for AI, not for people."
- "I had the holy shit red pill moment twice in my career."
- "I pay $100 a month for Claude Max. But I cancelled ~$200 worth of other subscriptions. I don't use Excel. I don't use ToDo apps. I don't use Feedly."

- "When everything seems crazy, ask yourself: where's the bottleneck?"

## Differences from outline

The as-delivered version diverged from the prepared outline in several ways:

1. **No explicit "translator wins" career advice section.** The prepared Section V ("What this means for you") with career strategy advice was not delivered. Instead, Brian went deeper on the personal knowledge system story, which became the climax.
2. **Much more personal.** Brian shared his own "red pill moment" story, the specifics of his Claude Code setup, cancelled subscriptions, and the emotional weight of the discovery. The outline was more structured; the delivery was more confessional.
3. **Q&A became a second talk.** The extended Q&A covered content creation strategy, open-source brains, connecting brains, startup differentiation, and practical how-to—none of which were in the slides.
4. **"Suicide button" moment.** Accidentally ended presentation mid-talk with clicker, recovered.
5. **Severance reference** (not in outline): used the show to illustrate that knowledge workers need "bird time"—unstructured thinking time.
6. **Copilot pricing critique** (not in outline): "$30/month to help write emails—that should be free."

## Notable ideas from delivery

These themes came up during the talk or Q&A beyond what was in the slides:

- **"I blog for AI, not for people."** Content creation reframe: blog posts become seed material for knowledge systems, not primarily for human readers.
- **Open-source brain.** Publishing a personal knowledge system publicly on GitHub, with file-by-file attribution and provenance of ideas.
- **Connecting brains.** Trusted people plugging their AI knowledge systems into each other for collaborative knowledge work.
- **"Dreaming" as a feature.** Nightly automated processes that scan a knowledge system, find connections, and present morning briefings.
- **Podcast capture workflow.** Screenshot a podcast on your phone while walking; the system finds the episode, pulls the transcript, extracts context at the timestamp, and files it.
- **Models as CPUs.** Core AI models are commoditized like processors. The model brand matters less than the surrounding context and infrastructure.
