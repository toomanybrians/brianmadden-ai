# Impact of AI: Explored - December 16, 2025

## Episode details

**Title:** AI 2026: When Agents, Browsers, and Security Collide

**Context:** Brian's third appearance on the show, now in his role as VP Technology Officer & Futurist at Citrix. A year-end review and 2026 predictions episode. At this point, computer-using agent benchmarks have crossed human parity, AI browsers have emerged as a security concern, and MCP has become ubiquitous. Brian is also using a personal second brain system built on markdown files.

**Key arguments made:**
- OSWorld computer-using agent benchmarks now at 76%, surpassing the 72% human baseline—this crossed human parity in 2025
- "Shadow strategy" not just "shadow AI"—workers aren't just using tools, they're doing strategic thinking with AI
- Microsoft Ignite survey: IT pros admit workers control AI; workers admit they use saved time for personal life
- AI browsers (Comet, Atlas, DIA) are a massive security threat—can log into corporate environments and take autonomous actions
- Enterprise browsers are now mandatory, not optional
- MCP is everywhere (30+ Microsoft announcements at Ignite referencing MCP), but security implementations vary wildly
- Work IQ concept: agents running inside secure environments rather than connectors pulling data out
- 2026 predictions: IT departments will finally wake up to worker-led AI as a real threat; multi-agent architectures will emerge; financial market correction won't invalidate the technology
- The gap between the frontier of what's possible and what average workers actually use is growing—but the frontier isn't practical yet
- "Even if all AI advancement stops today, enough technology already exists for AI to fundamentally change the way all knowledge work is done"
- Claude 4.5 specifically praised for matching Brian's voice and style
- Early description of what would become the second brain approach: markdown files with blog posts as writing style reference, dropped into every conversation

## Transcript

One of my beliefs is that in the future, everything we do with computers is going to go through AI. So right now, like I use my phone, I use apps, I use my laptop, I use devices, watch, buds, whatever. And I'm talking to like apps that humans wrote.

I don't think anyone's talking to apps anymore. I think everyone in the future is talking to AI.

We're talking, typing, looking at whatever. And then the AI itself is connecting to the data sources, the APIs, the MCPs, the applications, the—you know, it's running your desktop if it needs to, a browser, all that kind of stuff.

Hi everyone, welcome to the latest Impact of AI Explored. So we are doing our kind of end-of-year review. We have Brian Madden again. Brian has been on last year doing the same thing. So we're going to get kicked off. But Brian has recently moved roles and is now a futurist at Citrix. Brian, how are you doing? And what is a futurist?

Thanks, James and Gerjon. Thank you for having me back. You know, I joined you last year, I guess about a year ago, when I was an independent consultant, which was code for "between jobs." And we did the year-end interview and I'm really super happy to be joining you again. You've been crushing it on the show, obviously you all know that.

So yeah, I joined Citrix actually in February this year. So that's like 10-11 months ago, as a futurist. And what I do as a futurist, to be honest, it's not actually that different from what my role has been for the past 20 years as an industry analyst or kind of journalist or writer. Look at what's happening in the industry, summarize it, explain it: why is this important? What do you need to know? What does this mean? What are the different companies doing? It's the exact same job, except instead of doing it about what's happening today, just pivot slightly for what it looks like in a year or two or five years. What's important, how does work change, what are the issues?

As a futurist at Citrix, I do not work in our product group—I don't do product strategy. I really just paint the picture of what the world is going to look like in one to five years and share that with all my colleagues so they can build strategy and direction. And then of course I still go on stage and tell stories about what the future looks like.

Yeah. You were recently on stage at Microsoft Ignite doing it with Microsoft's futurist.

Yeah, that was super awesome. Marco Kasalena, who is a futurist at Microsoft. The session we did was like two futurists walk into a bar and just talk about the future of work. I have to say the Microsoft Ignite team changed our session title, but that was the point of our session. It wasn't even about Microsoft or Citrix, it was just like, "Okay, here's what's happening."

So we were recently at EUC Forum in London and we did our predictions from 2024 and what we got right and what we got wrong. And what did we give ourselves? B+.

Yeah. We got some of them right and we missed some big ones coming.

Yeah, we missed a couple of big ones, which in fairness, most things in AI hadn't even been thought of. One of the biggest ones we missed was AI browsers. Neither of us saw that one coming or the impact it's had. We've just released our latest episode where me and Gerjon talk about that because he's been using one quite a bit. And we talked about all the good and the bad things about AI browsers, but the main point we came to was: they're great for productivity, they're an absolute security nightmare.

I mean, I think a lot of that's a prototype, a proof of concept. One thing that's interesting with AI versus other technologies is all of these AI labs and vendors are doing their proofs of concept in public. They're going to put something out, it might be awful, I don't know, use it and tell us.

Like, we always make the joke about how in our society there are all these product liability disclosures, pages of legal ease. But it's funny how every AI box from all the vendors is like: "Amazing AI! Ask us anything! *Answers may be wrong.*" What world is this? The companies are like trillion-dollar companies. "Yeah, that seems fine. Ship it."

Could you imagine in consulting? "Here's a report that you just paid me $100,000 for. It might be all wrong. I don't know. Later."

There actually were consulting firms who put out reports like that, and there's been errors. But the other thing is the customer knows the consulting firm is using AI and says, "Hold on, you're using AI. I want a 50% reduction in my fee because you're not doing the work."

And it's not just consultants, it's all knowledge work. We're paid for our brain basically. We're not paid to do physical things. We're paid for our brains to think. And if I have AI and I'm more productive—well, what does "more productive" mean? If it's a task I could do in two hours and I now do in one hour, what do I do with that extra hour? Do I double the amount of work? Do I do the one task but twice as good? Do I go home and watch Netflix?

I did a survey at Microsoft Ignite. One of the questions was: if AI saves you an hour a day, what do you do? The highest response was, "I'm taking back personal time." The blog post I wrote about it: "IT admits workers are in charge of AI. Workers admit they use it to go home at 5."

Which is—I love the idea of workers kind of reclaiming time. We've all been asked to do more with less, taking on more and more, and now we finally have technology that can help us work as knowledge workers. And companies are like, "Oh great, all our workers are more productive, we'll get 20% more work." On what planet is that realistic? I think every actual worker is like, "Oh my gosh, I can finally not be working all night."

Now, let's talk about the year of agentic AI. What's your view? I don't think it was the year of agentic AI, but it was the dawn.

I'm going to answer in two parts. First, pure math. When we talked last year, I was talking about OSWorld, 369 tasks, and the median human can get 72% done successfully. At the time, the best AIs were like 40%. Well, guess what? The best one now is 76%. Humans are 72%. It was 70 last month, 68 the month before, 60 before that. AGI Inc. got 76%, all open source, you can click it, see their model, try it, run the test yourself.

Now, just because an AI knows how to use a computer as good as a human doesn't mean all our jobs are replaced. The human still needs to direct what the AI is doing. But the concept of "hey, go do my expense report"—I think we're pretty close.

The second part—yes, I agree hugely that we're just at the dawn. I was at a conference called MAICON, the Marketing AI Conference in Cleveland, and I was blown away by how basic the conversations were. Even in the speaker room, even the opening keynote. I'm like, this is so basic. And it occurred to me: we all live in the AI bubble. Just because the technology exists at phase five doesn't mean every human is there. Most workers are like, "Oh, I just use ChatGPT to help me write an email," which is the most basic thing that has existed for two or three years.

The frontier of the technology is moving really fast ahead, but that doesn't mean individual workers are there yet.

And here's the thing about AI browsers—this is a huge security problem. I was playing around with Comet and Atlas, and you can give it your company credentials and it can log on to your Office 365 web browser, set appointments, which is cool. But it could also do a gazillion other things when accessing the browser in company context.

Every company on planet Earth: you must use an enterprise browser. That doesn't have to be a dedicated one. At Citrix we use Chrome Enterprise Premium with extensions. Microsoft has Edge for Business. You log on with your work credential, and it has DLP, screenshot prevention, copy-paste prevention. If you're having your work available from any random web browser that's also AI right now—enterprise browsers have been around for five years, they're mature, easy to operate. That's a good first step. The days of just any old random browser from any random device—those days are over.

On MCP—Microsoft had like 30 separate announcements at Ignite that had MCP involved. And yes, there's tiny security on a lot of MCP servers. Andrew Morgan called them "Python honey pots," which is great. But don't let great be the enemy of good. MCP is fine enough. There's plenty of implementations done poorly, but that doesn't mean all MCP is bad. You can do MCP in a way that's authenticated and works like any sort of API. A lot of protocols that became standards, people thought were garbage early on. There'll be MCP 1.1 and it'll be fixed.

What Microsoft announced at Ignite around Work IQ is really cool. Instead of a connector pulling data out, it's more like an agent running within your Microsoft graph, in your secure environment. Imagine going to the library and saying, "I want all these files." And the librarian says, "Back up. What are you trying to do?" And then the librarian goes through everything internally, respecting all the rules and security permissions, and sends you back just the results you need.

For predictions—I think in 2026, IT departments are going to start to wake up. Right now they're worried about AI FOMO: "Every company is trying not to be the Blockbuster in the Netflix documentary." But in 2026, companies will recognize that workers using AI in ways they don't understand or approve actually affects the business.

And everyone's asking about the AI market crash. Probably there's going to be some kind of correction. But the financial market crashing doesn't mean the technology is no good. In the 1990s dotcom crash, pets.com crashed because no one was buying dog food through the mail. But today OpenAI has 800 million weekly users. I don't care if valuations go from 5 trillion to 1 trillion. I still really love using ChatGPT, and I'm going to keep using it regardless of what the stock market says.

My other prediction: I will be using AI and interacting with it even more 12 months from now than I do today.

On my own setup—I have documents in markdown files. Every time I write a blog post, I take all the text, put it in an MD file. So now I've got 40,000 words of my blogs from the past year. It's like, "This is how I write." And if I need to write in my style, I drop that reference in. I drop it into each chat every single time because I don't want it to assume anything.

And I have to say, Claude 4.5—holy moly, it nailed my voice and my style of operation.
