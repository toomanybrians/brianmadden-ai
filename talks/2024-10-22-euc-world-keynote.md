# EUC World: Independence 2024 - October 22

## Talk details

**Title:** EUC past, present, and future

**Abstract:** A tour through 20 years of end-user computing delivered in the same building where BriForum started. Brian traces the arc from desktop management through VDI, mobile, and the consumerization of IT, then argues that the Windows desktop is becoming the API for AI agents. Covers Microsoft Recall, Copilot Vision, computer-using agents, the Windows Agent Arena, and why the desktop running in the cloud may be the entry point for AI into the enterprise.

## Transcript

Thanks, everyone. This is really something special to be here at EUC World Independence Silver Spring, Maryland. A quick program note: this presentation is at AI-L—that's "AI Influence Level." This presentation is completely human-generated, no AI involved. Today's talk is EUC past, present, and future. Hello, my name is Brian Madden, and I'll be your first speaker.

To look at the past, present, and future, we have to start with the past. I can dial back about 20 years—almost exactly—to this very building, this very stage, where a kid spoke 20 years ago at the first BriForum conference. BriForum was a community event we ended up doing about 20 times over 12 to 15 years. A lot of us here know each other from BriForum. It wasn't the first community event—we all ride on the shoulders of giants before us—but BriForum became a gathering place, and we had Masters Retreat, we have EUC World Independence, and there'll be others after this.

The common thread running through all of this is the community and the people in this room. That's what's been most special to me in the past 20 years. If you go back to that first BriForum in this building, I think there are six of us still here. Tim Mangan, Alex D, Sean—I just want to tell you those photos are from 2005. There's Luca, Benny, Gabe. The picture I love most of Gabe is that he's on the ground fixing something, crawling around kind of fixing things, which is classic Gabe. But here in the upper right corner—this is this room right now, where we are today. That's where we were giving that presentation. I love that that presentation is called "The Future of Citrix"—curious what we thought back then. We figured we'd have like Citrix Zeon 12, 1024 by 768 resolution, we'd solve the problem of Citrix session printing, we'd finally figured out group policies, Windows XP is obviously rocking. That was good. BriForum was really about server-based computing—terminal server and Citrix primarily—and that kicked off this series of events here 20 years ago.

I want to talk today about EUC—sort of past, present, and future. BriForum wasn't the beginning of EUC; it was just the beginning of that particular phase. My story goes back a little further, even to 1994, when I began my tech career. This is my very first brochure—a little trifold I had for setting up local businesses. I would go over and fix your computer. Back then, installing RAM, installing CD-ROM drives, IRQ and DMA jumpers, sound blasters. You know, one trip over the network cable would take down the whole network. It was something else.

It's crazy though—30 years. That's a long time, and it doesn't feel like 30 years. I mean, I can't do things I could do 30 years ago, but it doesn't actually feel like a 30-year career. If I look at my tech career, I think it probably mirrors a lot of yours. I went from being a PC technician in 1994 working with Novell NetWare, desktop engineering, SMS, Citrix, ASPs, blades, VMware, VDI, HCI, MDM, MAM, EMM, consumerization of IT, digital workspace, future of work. Everything on that timeline I was really into—there were books, forums, certifications, conferences for each of these things. I was way into all of these.

But it's funny because where is it going? Where is the next thing? AI, I guess. That seems to be what we say is next. For me, the best way to look at where things are growing is to go back to the past, present, and future and look at where things have been, how we got here, and then just continue drawing those lines. For that, I want to rewind even further, maybe to before 1994, to the very beginning.

Humans came along, and pretty soon they started organizing into offices with desks. Then the computer came out. One person got a computer on their desk, and then suddenly everyone wanted one. We had to figure out what to do with them, how to deal with them, how to standardize them. We were so confused. We needed a master plan, someone to lead us and help us figure out how to get there. We ordered them by the pallet—give me a pallet of laptops, then send me another pallet of laptops. If you missed the first 10 to 15 years of the end-user computing revolution, you're now caught up.

Back in the '90s, the daily job of a desktop administrator was managing laptops by imaging. You'd create a gold master image, deploy it, update with patches, patch it, update it, patch it. Eventually it got so janky you'd just reimage it and repeat. After a decade of this, we thought: there's got to be a better way. What if we go back to the same source? Systems Management Server. SMS from 1994. That's the correct response. It's like Steve Jobs said about the car—if you ask people what they want, they describe a faster horse. Well, SMS was the faster horse. It didn't change the circular model; it just let you automate it. Automation sounds great, but the problem is the history of automation means breaking things very bigly all at once. If you push out patches with SMS, you find out—well, there's that saying about God and atheists in foxholes. It was the original spray and pray. You're just hoping at least 80% of desktops don't blue screen in the morning. We solved that too, but we needed a better way. This was a faster horse—it didn't get tired, but it didn't fundamentally solve our problems. But it was all we had.

Then this thing came along in the mid-'90s. You recognize this? That's right, Citrix. Some of you are confused. That's what Citrix was. This is Citrix's actual marketing material from 1998. The Citrix marketing message in those days was MAPS: Management, Access, Performance, Security. You'd use Citrix in the 1990s for easier management—install an application once instead of on any machine. Your employees could access it from anywhere, any device. It had good performance for client-server apps because it ran in the data center. It had security because it was only pixels, no data at rest on the client device. That's why we used Citrix then. Notice we're not using words like "remote anywhere," "work anywhere," "enabling fun work styles," "modernization." We used Citrix then because it was better than what we had. It was a fundamentally new way of doing things.

When I was first exposed to Citrix servers in 1997, they were running on Cubix hardware—Citrix software and Cubix hardware, very confusing. I was like, oh my God, I can install the Oracle client once, update my TNF names.ora file once, and everyone's updated. For me, Citrix wasn't the future of my life or the industry; it was just a better way to manage my desktops and applications. It had some issues. It was tricky. Jeroen van de Kamp stood on this exact stage at BriForum 2005 and talked about the shadow key, install mode and execute mode. Very complicated. But we did it because it was better than the other way. So the Citrix thing worked out for us.

Then this little company came around. If you don't recognize them, this is VMware. The VMware approach was: we're like Citrix, but we don't have all those complications because it's just regular VMs. In fact, if one VM is good, more VMs are better. VM sprawl was so easy to create. How could that go wrong? VMs followed us everywhere. We had VMs just everywhere. How did that end up for us when we turned everything into a VM? It was fine, a little over-rotation, but we were trying new things.

VDI, over the years—in 2005 when I first stood on stage, VDI wasn't a thing. Some people were just starting to do it, but they didn't have a standardized name or commercialization. But by about 2008, VDI is like Citrix without the pain of Citrix, right? I love you, VDI. Then we started playing with it more and saying, hey, what's IOPS? We learned some things and thought, oh my God, VDI sucks, it's too slow, it'll never work. Then we realized we could have EnV storage, Block Level single-instance copy-on-write, and all this kind of stuff. VDI, I love you. By 2012, VDI was awesome. Then we're like, wait, we have GPU now? What the [bleeped] happened here? So VDI is [bleeped], but now we can put GPUs in these things. VDI is awesome, I love you. Then 2020 came around with COVID, and we're like, VDI, I need you. Yeah, okay, fine, I guess, whatever. They cracked the door open, and we realized it was cool. They're like, oh, and by the way, we're going to make this all in the cloud too, which makes it easier. We're like, okay, fine. And again, while we got you here, if you just pay for this every single month forever. At that point you're like, Jesus Christ, fine, yes, just let me have it.

We got to the point where not only were we fine with VDI, we were fine with it running somewhere else, we don't really even identify with where it is, and we're just paying for it forever. That's just the way it is now. Could you imagine if we talked about that in 2005? It's going to be all a service, you're going to pay by month and pay forever. We'd be like, yeah, that seems fine, that's a good future for us.

Over time, the Windows desktop became ubiquitous because of VDI, because of Citrix, because of Windows. We had remote VMs, we had VDI, we had remote sessions for the Windows desktop, we had client-native installations, we could run desktops on VMs. We really had all these different ways, all about the Windows desktop. We could deliver the hell out of the Windows desktop. But there's more than just Windows out there. There's what happens away from the desk too. In the real world, Windows desktops are great for our desks, but what about when we're out in the real world?

Going back to 1994 when I began this, our mobile lives were a little different back then. We had laptops, the cool people had Macs, we had mobility, mobile devices, tablets. These were all things happening in the mid-'90s, but we weren't doing real work the same way. Real mobility work took five years to hit the average office worker. And you all know what that was—the RIM 850 BlackBerry from 1999. This was it. Push email, you didn't have to log in. You could set your Outlook settings to use plain text email so no one would know you're on the golf course instead of working. This really enabled use cases. Fun fact: this thing ran a 386 on the inside. Another fun fact: Pat Gelsinger was one of the design architects—he was a lead architect on the 486, but he was a staff architect on the 386 and snuck his initials in three different places. Your BlackBerry has PG in it.

So this was 1999, and we're just starting to see that working outside the office is becoming a thing. But it's crazy because this didn't happen until eight years later. We had eight years where the BlackBerry was the direction of things. This first iPhone had no video camera, just a backward-facing still camera. There were no apps, no integration with your corporate Exchange Server or anything like that. Even when this came out, the business world kind of dismissed it as just a toy for kids. Real business people use BlackBerries.

Of course, the iPhone came out, Android came out, there were full Windows phones. In 2010 to 2012, the way we solved mobility in EUC was: you want to do real work on this? Well, here's a remote desktop session. People, rich people, stood on stage with this to rapturous applause when you could get your remote window session on these devices. This was a really big deal, horrible user experience, and it didn't catch on. This was an absolute emergency, but this was our plan. The Windows desktop is for work. You must have a Windows desktop to work. It's crazy because when Satya Nadella became CEO of Microsoft, his first public event was to announce the Office app on the iPad in 2014. You could not use Microsoft Office from a mobile device before this unless you were using Citrix or VMware to remote the whole desktop. It was another eight months before they released Office for iPhones. So in 2014, that's relatively recent, but back then we thought everything happens on the desktop, that's the only way we can do things.

Now we got to the point where we can actually put Office native apps on these devices, so these devices started becoming cool. A lot of our employees started using them and enjoying them. They thought it was much cooler to have an iPhone than a BlackBerry. In IT, we thought, no, I see this and think, yeah, how do I convert that to a BlackBerry? I want the lockdown I used to have with BlackBerries. Oh, it's called MDM. Let me just configure some settings. Perfect. I'm now very happy as an IT admin. The employees, not so much. This is when we learned about something called the consumerization of IT. You can summarize it in one image. You are caught up. The best part about this? There's a dashboard somewhere that's all green. Compliance alert says we need a gate. The gate must be this high, it must be actuated, it must be this strong, must be this color, must have reflective tape. They installed that gate, someone walked there to inspect it, verified it works properly, tested it and plugged it in, has backup and everything. That is compliance. It is green. Everything is fine. That's what started happening around the time iPhones came out. All these web apps and SaaS applications came out, and that was what changed. Finally, our employees could buy these tools directly themselves that were better than what we had. In the old days it was in charge, but now if our employees don't like what we provide, they'll just buy whatever they want and start using it anyway.

The consumerization of IT. The way to visualize this is to look at the capabilities of technology that your employees have at home and then look at what capabilities you provide at work. That delta right there—that's the consumerization of IT. It was a big deal. Over time, we've actually shrunk that gap because we have native iOS Office applications, separation of work and personal on our devices, native iOS versions of lots of applications. If you want to work in the mobile way, it's not just a remote desktop. We changed the whole way that it operates. This whole thing became a service. Focus on employee satisfaction, service-oriented, become the department of enabling our employees to do what they want instead of saying no, no, no. This was a 10-year transition. It was not easy, but we got there. I think most people generally speaking are able to use the IT that their company provides and work the way they want to work nowadays, and it's secure, it has performance, compliance, and all those things.

I was working at BlackBerry when the consumerization happened. The actual thing that started to change when companies decided to go to iPhones is when CIOs and CTOs were pissed they didn't get Netflix on their BlackBerry. That was really what happened. The problem was that app vendors would not build apps for the BlackBerry store. Literally, people started buying iPhones because of Netflix. The same time in 2008 or 2009, they said, I can't get Netflix on my BlackBerry, okay, I'm getting an iPhone. That was the thing. The takeaway is that our employees are going to want to work and use the devices that they want to use, and it's up to us to orient to them. I'm glossing over 10 years of history here, but we got there. I feel like we're doing a pretty good job.

Looking at all of our employees—they're a diverse crew. They do everything, work in different ways, live all over the place. But the employees will say, I look at what they need and think, okay, they want to use iOS or Android. I don't really care which one anymore because I can manage both of them and secure both. You got iOS or Android for your mobile devices. You want to use a Mac or Windows? Again, I don't exactly super care which one you use because I can use VDI or Citrix to deliver your Windows apps to you. So honestly, when I look at this, I don't hate it. I've got iOS, I've got mobile devices, I've got physical devices, I've got some VDI for my Windows desktops. I can handle a lot of employees in a lot of different situations. I'm feeling good about this.

The thing is, I want a way to manage this that's not all separate and disjointed. We had this thing called Unified Endpoint Management, or UEM. About 10 years ago we started looking at UEM, thinking we'll let our employees use all the devices and platforms and applications they want, we'll create one product to manage it all. I love this vision of UEM—that I can manage everything with this. But it's interesting because if I look at these three product categories—I say I want a UEM product to manage my Windows desktops, my physical devices, my mobile devices—there are a lot of different options. I can throw up a bunch of different vendors in each of these spaces and I'm not even sure if it's complete. Just check Ruben's hexagrid for the latest list. But the point is there are a lot of options.

Then we start to get into these games of, okay, there are different product features, some products are expensive, some are cheap, some have more features, some have fewer. There are different use cases, and I'm trying to map the products I want to use onto the use cases I have. When I start digging into this, I think, what is my actual use case? I need VDI to provide remote access for my employees, maybe for training centers, showing people how to use different things, probably for developers who want to develop Mac applications and remote into a Mac VDI environment. Interns, contractors—there are lots of scenarios where I need VDI or RDSH. On the physical side, I've got different use cases. I've got legacy PCs, brand new laptops, laptops that I let employees do whatever they want with, and various BOD scenarios with different rules. With mobile, I've got devices I own, devices employees own, Zebra devices on Tow Motors that won't die. I have all these different things to manage.

What's interesting is that I actually have a lot of different use cases here. There's technology that can solve all of these, but it's very complicated to find one platform that's truly supporting all of these. In fact, these are even managed by different people, possibly in different parts of the world. There's a mix of apps—legacy apps, cloud-native SaaS, locally installed. I've got a mix of all these use cases across multiple business units, multiple management structures, and probably multiple countries or different states with different regulations. Everything gets very complicated very quickly.

We had this idea that there's this UEM that's going to solve all of this. But the problem is now I have to pick one product. There are multiple vendors that make UEM products, but which one actually checks all your boxes? I did a project earlier this year where we were doing this exact thing. We looked at all the customer requirements and tried to find the one that matches. My colleagues said, well, we'll find one that's the most green. I'm like, if you have any red—if the customer needs something and you can't fulfill it—then it doesn't work. One does this, another does that, so what ends up happening is the vision of unified endpoint management breaks down because the real world is so much more complicated than what can be rolled up into a single product.

We used to think you'd have a single management product to manage iOS and Windows and map the settings back and forth. It's just too complicated. All these things are different, they're always changing. Different departments, different users, different management, different countries, different regulations. The idea of unified management across all that is really failed to catch on in any meaningful way. What I really want is security, zero trust, compliance. If you talk to a CIO, they don't care if you're using Citrix, Intune, or anyone else. You do what you have to do. But talk to a CIO and they'll say, here's what I care about: I don't want to be on the news, I don't want to get ransomed, I don't want to have to buy all my customers two years of credit monitoring service. I don't want to have to go to my board and tell them we have to close for a week and a half while we buy new computers at Best Buy. I don't care what you do. I'm telling you, whatever you have to do, just don't let us get attacked.

On the management side, I want to understand what my employees are doing—are they working, do they have the devices they need? I don't care what device, what platform, who sends the bits to flip register keys, whose agent is on there. I just want to be able to zoom back and say, what does my user estate look like? The final thing is the digital employee experience. This is more than just looking at performance counters for alerts. This is: are my employees able to do their jobs? If I really look at it, I don't care about platform, I don't care about device. There are actually a lot of things I don't care about. All that traditional stuff—whether it's VDI, RDSH, local, whether it's Windows, Mac, Linux, whether it's web-native, native platform applications, whether it's SaaS or subscription, whether it's cloud or on-premise—I don't care about any of that. Yes, this is important, but I don't care about what brand alternator is in my car. I care when I turn the key and it drives and I can get there. Someone who knows way more about alternators than me is going to put the right alternator in, but when you zoom back, all these things are very important. But all of this stuff is not what's driving the strategy for end-user computing. What's driving the strategy is the services and capabilities across the top.

This really is the takeaway. I just made up these three, but you might have three different or five. The point is we're looking at what we can actually get out of our technology, not the technologies themselves. We're the practitioners in this room, so we're very dialed into what the technologies are, as it should be. But there's a level above that. There's that big elephant in the room of, well, what does that mean for Windows? If everything is abstracted, we don't need Windows anymore, right? Windows is dead. I've been using this slide for 20 years. Back in 2005, oh, ASP.NET, Windows is dead. Java, Windows is dead. AJAX framework, HTML5, Windows is dead. VDI, Windows is dead. Chromebooks, Windows is dead. All these things have been killing Windows year after year after year. But it's funny if you look at the data from 2009 to 2023, you see Mac on the bottom and Windows on top. Okay, Windows is losing market share, but let's draw that line out and look at it on a real-time scale. Man, wake me up when this is interesting. This is way too long a timeframe for me to care about. Frankly, I'm not worried about Windows in the box. I'm worried about me in the box. Windows ain't going anywhere.

Windows has been predicted to be dying forever. Another slide I've been using forever is when this happens—when apocalypse happens—we'll have cockroaches, we'll have Twinkies, and we'll have devices powered by the Microsoft Windows operating system. It's cool that we're going to be the cool ones in the room knowing how to work with these things. But Windows is not going anywhere. There's even a resurgence of Windows. AI PCs are making Windows exciting. Apple finally has a run for the money from Microsoft. But the point is Windows is going to be around for a long time. For this conversation, I don't want to confuse Windows and desktops. When we talk about Windows, we're really talking about desktops. Are desktops a thing in the future?

Let's look a couple years ahead. In 2029, who needs a desktop because Windows is going to die, right? Well, desktops are going to be dead, we'll have AR, VR, our hands do things, we talk to computers, there are devices, they project. Who needs a desktop anymore? That's what everyone thinks. But then you think of your own connection, your own setup. How many of you have offices like this? This isn't new. We've been doing this for 20 years. Look at that Trinitron on the four-monitor setup with ergonomics like way ahead of time. That mouse cost like $80. We've been really into our Windows desktops for quite some time. If you think about it, there are so many activities you need to do—coding, graphic design, building PowerPoints, multiple windows, multiple applications. The reality is the Windows desktop is a framework that lets all of our applications connect to each other, copying and pasting, using all the Windows-based models, printing, plugins. It's a security container, it's an authentication place, it's a place to audit and record. The desktop as a model is not going away, even though we have more options to compute in more ways.

I don't know how many of you are using ChatGPT advanced voice where it sounds like a conversation. You can talk to it, you can interrupt it. You can't write an article that way though because it's like a different part of your brain when you're talking to something versus when you're seeing visually. I can talk through what I want in the article, but I just can't narrate in the same way. It's just a different form factor. As a concept, sitting in front of some kind of display device and interacting with visual content is going to exist for a very long time. So given that and looking ahead, if our desktop is going to exist for a while, then looping back to the AI stuff I started with, what is the future? What is the next thing in our careers?

I've been doing AI for a while. ChatGPT came out in 2022. I know I didn't use it then. My whole life from '77 to '24, I found AI somewhere recently, quite seriously around the beginning of 2023. ChatGPT was up for six months before I even used it. It was a dirty limerick generator at first for me. Then I realized, oh, you ask a work question and it answers it and you're like, huh. For me, I've really jumped into studying AI, but only for the past 18 months or so. It's not very long. But AI wasn't totally foreign to me because for those first 45 years of my life I definitely knew what AI was. I had the same study resources that you had—2001: A Space Odyssey, Terminator, Her. You laugh, but that's how computers work. They get smarter, they disobey humans, AI killer robots, AI sex partners. That caught up. So this is my vision of AI for the first 45 years, and then this little sliver right here is where I'm at now. I'm into it. I think it's going to really affect things.

I think AI is—everyone here says this, but this is the biggest change in my entire career. I came online right when the internet was becoming a thing. Bigger than mobile, bigger than web. I think this is huge. One of the things people think about is everyone has opinions on ChatGPT. Just remember we are in the very beginning of this development. ChatGPT today is like a DOS prompt. If you saw a home computer in 1983 and someone said, this will eventually become an iPhone, you couldn't see it. There are a lot of steps and it's a huge jump, but that's exactly the direction it's going. We're seeing little bits—you can give them pictures, videos, you can talk to them, you can give them audio. This is not going to be the interface we're using forever with these language models.

There's an article I wrote on LinkedIn. I'm writing everything on LinkedIn now if you want to follow what I'm doing. When Microsoft announced their Recall feature—it takes a screenshot of your machine every 5 seconds and stores it in a secure place—there was some hubbub around it being rushed out and not very secure. But as we know, Microsoft eventually gets things right. They just keep chunking away, punching, punching, punching. And the old rule was never use version 1 of a Microsoft product. Microsoft Recall is going to be fixed. It's going to be the way things work. Today, Recall just takes screenshots of your laptop every 5 seconds, and you can then use an AI to Google it, Bing it, and say, what was that pink thing I saw last week on the web?

In that article, I was basically saying, look, this Recall thing might be crazy, but get on board because this is happening. In that article, I said look, this is going to evolve. Today, Recall is just looking at pictures. I think in the future, Recall starts to understand what you're doing. So rather than a search interface for everything you've done, it starts to understand the intent. Now you can be like, hey, when was I creating this talk last week? And it knows kind of where you were and can pull you back into that context.

Next, it starts to integrate with other Microsoft Copilots—150 in counting, 150-plus Copilot-branded products from Microsoft today. I think beyond that, something like Recall becomes more like an AI agent. It starts to be able to do things for you. Maybe in the initial version, it's like while you're watching it, it's actually taking your mouse and moving it around and looking at the screen. I think eventually it does more and more of your job, maybe all the boring parts. There are a lot of people that believe that the way AI enters the knowledge world is not that everything you do is replaced by AI, but rather you can look at what you do, break it down into about 100 different tasks, and AI can do like three of them today. In a few months, it can do four, then five, and eventually AI can do like a quarter of your tasks. Do you do more tasks? Do you not tell people? Do you get rid of a quarter of people and have more AI? Who knows, yes to all of these. It's going to be crazy, but the point is AI is going to get better and better at doing more and more of your job.

Beyond that, you can't even predict a year or two out. This article I wrote in May—that's six months ago—look at it since then. Here's October first. This is this month, three weeks ago. Introducing Copilot Vision. Copilot Vision is not Microsoft Recall; Copilot Vision is a separate product. It plugs into the Edge browser and it's in testing phase right now. Microsoft only lets it operate on certain pre-approved websites. The idea is turn on Copilot Vision, you kind of co-browse the web together, and it can help you. You can ask it questions about what you're seeing, have it summarize things, help you fill out forms. So this is Microsoft just tiptoeing into actually interacting with the desktop as opposed to just archiving or scraping it.

Another interesting thing is a blog post from last week, five days ago, from Simon Willison. He's one of the AI people I love to follow. He did this little example of video scraping and extracting JSON data from a 35-second screen capture for less than one tenth of a penny. Very simple, you can do this yourself. Go to ai.google.com. You can have this on your phone right now. He had invoices that he wanted to have JSON data for. He literally started a screen recorder, highlighted a section of the screen, paged down to open each email one by one and one, dropped that video into the AI studio, and said, give me JSON data format of these outputs. That was it. It cost less than a penny to do that. Simon Willison's blog is full of these kinds of things—oh look at this cool thing I just did with AI, and you can all do it yourself. You don't have to be an AI engineer.

What if your job was to open all these emails and extract the data? In the old days, we'd use RPA, but RPA you have to program and they're very brittle and all these kinds of things. We're seeing this with just a small model. Gemini Flash is a small one, but this is not even a special-purpose model. There's a paper from April of this year describing an AI model that understands what's on your screen and understands the UI elements. You can take a screenshot and give it to ChatGPT and say, what do you see on the screen, and ChatGPT can do that. But ChatGPT is expensive and slow because it can do a trillion other things. If you make a very special-purpose model whose only reason for existence is to understand UI elements on the screen, it's cheap and it's fast—faster than your frame rates. So now you can analyze screenshots in real time.

There's another paper from September, last month, about understanding user intent. This is another very small, very specialized model which can look at a user on a screen and say, oh, they went to file, open new email, clicked here, and figure out what the users are doing based on the actions. You can use this for training or just interacting in general. Tiny, small, fast. A lot of people believe that much like the way the human brain works—we have different parts, video processing, audio, thinking—AI will be the same way. There's probably not going to be one quadrillion gazillion model, GPT-17 that does everything. It's all these little models wired together for very specialized use cases. Some run on your device, some in the cloud, all kind of working together.

The thing is, again, these are real things you can play with right now. Google AI Studio, LLM Studio, you can download it as an open-source app, plug right into these models on Hugging Face, play with them locally. It's just like the early days of working with the cloud. Give yourself a hundred bucks in credits and start noodling around in there.

To tie this back to Microsoft: there's something called the Windows Agent Arena. This paper is from September, so again, within the past month. Microsoft has defined a specification for what a Windows agent ought to be able to do. They give it a list of about 150 things like change the desktop, send email to Tim, change the settings, do this, install something. They have a list of tasks. The people who built this have VM templates you can use so it's all the same for everybody. You can build your own AI agent, maybe in Python, whatever, and then see how good the scores are. Give it the list of things to do and see how it scores. Right now it's only scoring at 17% success, so humans are safe for like the next six months. But the point is this is real. Microsoft is doing this. This Windows Agent Arena exists. You can download it. It's all open source in GitHub. Go ahead and improve it.

One more thing: this is from yesterday. Microsoft says Copilot AI agents are set to tackle employee tasks in November. That's like two weeks from now. Microsoft announced their Copilot Studio and their agent infrastructure earlier this year, and they think they're going to have agents ready to go that can actually do things on your behalf in a few weeks. To me, this is where the future of end-user computing really is.

The Windows desktop for us, for all these years, has been the place where we worked. The work we did there was the applications, and we thought we were doing knowledge work, but it didn't have real knowledge. Knowledge work is like document searching, keyword tagging, moving data from system to system. But the real knowledge within an organization is all that institutional knowledge, the soft knowledge. At VMware with 40,000 employees, how do you get things done? It's not on the internet. You have to know, oh, you call this person, they do that, they do over here. There's that knowledge. Once we have these agents, they start paying attention to all the employees in a company and can start to figure those things out. Now we start to get real actual understanding and knowledge of what the end-user computing environment is like.

For me, end-user computing is always about employees and the technology and that interaction. But for the past 20 to 30 years, all we've been dealing with primarily is form factors—it's a Windows desktop, it's a mobile device, it's a VDI version of a Windows desktop. But now we're getting to where the computers can help us with the knowledgey part of our job—for real knowledge, not just metadata tags on a document you're searching for.

The reason I like the desktop as part of this conversation is that every application I have already exists in my desktop. There are a lot of companies like Zapier that are like, oh, we're going to be your AI automation agent. They have plugins for all these different applications, and you give them your keys and they can log into your Google and your Microsoft and your Zoom and connect them all together. But it's not everything. Your company has a billion internal applications with plugins and snap-ins and ways of doing things and custom desktop images. You spent 30 years building the perfect environment for employee productivity. Your end-user computing environment already exists. It's your desktop, and that is where you plug AI into.

If you look at the traditional applications and now think of every one of our AI agents, I can use the desktop and I've got access to the first application I need. If that application calls another application, it's all right there on the desktop. The desktop already has my security context, it has my audit trails, it's managed, I can move it around. All of my AI agents now can use the desktop as their go-to place for all the applications. That means the desktop is the API for all of your AI agents. I don't believe we need to reinvent this from scratch.

The story told about UEM—you think about it theoretically and it sounds good: one platform to manage all of our devices. We as an industry, and there are certainly plenty of use cases where it works, but fundamentally it was easier to just have different platforms manage all of our devices and roll up the data and the important things we need across everything. I think it's the same here. Whatever ends up being the easiest thing that works—the reason we do things the way we do is because of the knowledge and the way we've done things in the past. We already have these Windows desktops that are perfectly built to have all of our applications coming together. Just point the AI towards those applications, towards that desktop, and now we really can have a superpowered AI. Suddenly this is not a liability anymore. Suddenly this is an asset. The fact that we have a desktop and that desktop has all of our applications and all of our data—there are a million stories online. You need to extract a bunch of information out of a SQL database? Well, just use a query explorer and run your query and then page down a bunch of times and have an AI scrape it. All the interfaces to do everything we need already exist. This method—all the complicated integration work is done. It's secure, we have an audit trail, we know how to do it, and it's compatible with the old way of doing things.

The way we think about it currently, we already have a way to deliver secure, protected, etc., the desktop. And by the way, if you now move that desktop—because of course we have desktops running on your devices and desktops running in the cloud—the AI agents could plug into both or either. But if you put that desktop in the cloud, now it gets kind of interesting. I'm promoting this desktop to a user. We have spent almost 25 years extracting the essence of that desktop into a pixel stream and sending that pixel stream down to our end-users. Well, now maybe that pixel stream, instead of just going through the gauntlet of compression, encryption, prioritization, QOS, and all that kind of stuff, maybe we add more pieces. Maybe we add screen and text archiving, maybe for legal reasons or for forensic search. I can do that at that protocol level. I don't even need that agent necessarily running inside my desktop.

Maybe I want to do some DEX analytics for how good the performance is. Again, I can watch the screen that's going through. I don't even have to get involved. I can have that to my desktop protocol broadcast out to five different locations—some of those are AI agents doing things and others are the actual employee themselves. I can do workforce analytics to understand the intent and what the employees are doing. I love the idea of opening up a new document for a new strategic plan and having Clippy 2.0 pop up and say, oh, did you know there's a coworker in Singapore literally doing this exact same thing right now? You want to schedule a Zoom? I'm like, yeah, we do. There's a lot that can come out of that.

Things like compliance—I can record the screen remotely, I can blur out sections for GDPR compliance. So the general idea is when I take my desktop and put it somewhere else, now the fact that I'm remoting those pixels down for a human to understand means the AI can understand those as well. I don't have to overload my VDI servers, I don't have to overload my users. I might have something with secure appliances hooking in for audit purposes. It can be very dematerialized in a way that we've all known about but can be very powerful.

To tie this together, this is from "The Intelligence Age" essay by Sam Altman on his iia.ai site. It's confusing because it's not ai.ai, it's IIA for "Intelligence Age." Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, put this out about a month ago on how these models are moving to agent-based AI. The AI agent right now, when you connect into ChatGPT, when you close that window, it's gone. But imagine it's running in a container, something keeps running, you can do things on your behalf even if you're not directly interacting with it. And then of course, maybe you can do things on your behalf against your VDI when you're not directly interacting with it. That's kind of the idea of these AI agents and where we see them going.

There's a lot of fun experimentation happening right now. Open Interpreter is an open-source project where you can take ChatGPT today and make it run your desktop. Yeah, I mean you're giving it the ability to record and stream your desktop, so think about that. But if you want to play around with it and understand what it's doing, this is an open-source project and people are going down this path today.

Ironically, the old saying about how the more things change, the more they are the same, history repeats itself—for me, this picture is pretty relevant. I feel like even in the next few years, MAPS—Management, Access, Performance, Security. Well, thinking of this in the world of VDI. If I want to build that sort of AI agent thing for my desktop, it sort of always needs to be running. Put that in the cloud in my VDI session or whatever. All the benefits that Citrix gave us in 1997 are the exact same benefits of today. Management—of course I've got everything centrally, I'm able to manage. Access—I can access from any device. Now I don't need an AI PC, I don't have to have a GPU with 40 teraflops or whatever on my laptop. My VDI session has it. I have great separation of work and personal. I'm like super creeped out if Microsoft Recall is recording my laptop, but if I had a VDI session on the laptop and it's like, hey, your VDI session is work only, everything's recorded on here, but the personal side of things isn't recorded, I could probably get behind that. Especially if I knew that all my other employees had that and the AI was helping us all work together in a more effective way. I get good performance regardless of the device and where I am. I get the security of no data at rest on the end device. The exact same story from 30 years ago really works very well for us in this AI world as well.

For me, it's kind of funny because for all of this to happen, what I'm saying is the desktop is where it all takes place. The desktop is the center, the hub. But we have to have the desktop always running, so I guess that puts it in the cloud or whatever. So I'm like, man, so the future is everyone has their own desktop that's always running in the cloud. I'm like, uh, let's go. Does that mean—could it finally be time that 2025 is actually the year of VDI? Something I literally never said before. This is not my quote, but I'm going to say right now: 2025 is going to be the year of VDI because of AI. And the way we're doing it is because of everyone here in this room. All of you.
