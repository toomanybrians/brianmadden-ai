## Transcript

Hey, good afternoon. Thank you. This is my first time at a live tech event since the before-times. It's fantastic—what a fantastic venue and opportunity to be here for the VMUG Netherlands. It's always been a big event, and it's a good crowd. I spent a lot of time in the Netherlands over the years, and I'm very excited to be here.

The theme today is about AI. When I think about AI, I feel like a lot of people are doing really cool stuff with it, but those are other people—not me. I feel like the AI train has left the station and I missed it. All I hear is how important it is, the skills we need, how it's changing everything. And I'm like, I am so [bleeped] because I missed the AI train.

My name is Brian Madden. I'm so happy to be here, and thank you to the organizers for inviting me. I've been in IT for 30 years. May 1994 is when I took money to touch someone else's computer for the first time—LANtastic, by the way. So I've been in it for 30 years, and I've had an insanely rewarding career. I'm here today to stand on stage and tell you that I have absolutely no idea what I'm doing. I'm wide open in the bright lights, haven't had a clue.

I feel like I had a clue in the past, though. I look back at my career—I did brianmadden.com for 15 years, wrote or edited published eight different books about VDI and Citrix and DaaS and Enterprise Mobility. I created a conference called BriForum. I worked at VMware. I worked for Shawn Bass in the EUC Office of the CTO. I worked with this really tall bearded guy with an orange beard—we drew on glass and had to learn how to write backwards. That was fantastic.

Then I left VMware a couple years ago to work at a pinball company—the actual ball you move around with the flippers. We built software and hardware for other people's pinball machines. Labyrinth is a machine that runs on our platform. I did all the documentation, diagrams, and technical explainers, just like I was doing in tech.

A couple months ago, I wrote that I'm moving to Paris and joining a consulting company called ILKI. ILKI is a consulting and analyst company. We are not a vendor partner—we don't partner with any vendors. We're completely independent. So after working at vendors over the years, I'm now completely independent, which means I can say whatever I want. Not that it ever stopped me before, but I had a very rewarding 30 years. I've done a lot of great things, but now I'm here thinking—what am I doing? That's in the past.

I'm back in IT now. I spent a couple years after VMware working on the pinball thing as a refresh, recharge—doing something not about HIPAA compliance and GDPR compliance and all that stuff. But now I'm back doing consulting and working in digital workspace and things like that. Let me see what's been happening in the EUC space.

There's that company Citrix that did a lot of stuff, but they're looking different now. They're owned by a private equity company—that's weird. VMware, of course, I worked with a lot, but they're also owned by private equity now, and VMware is becoming a private equity company. These were my favorites—my whole world was Citrix, VMware, or Microsoft. What's happening? How is Microsoft doing? Not bad—a three-trillion-dollar market cap. The funny stat I saw the other day is that Microsoft is not only higher market cap than Apple, but they're one full Tesla market cap higher than Apple. What is happening?

VMware is now owned by private equity, and customers are getting nervous. Citrix is owned by private equity, and customers are getting nervous. Microsoft is crushing it. Everyone loves them and they're the most valuable company in the known universe. How long was I asleep? That was a hell of a pinball game I played. What is happening in our world? I don't recognize it anymore.

I think about how things turn over. There's a popular book in the US called "The Fourth Turning"—you can read it or listen to a podcast. The gist is that generations like Baby Boomers and Gen Z, Gen X—they're 20 to 25 years each. But every four generations is 80 to 100 years, which is a macro cycle that follows the seasons. I've been thinking about the seasons of life and the seasons of a company, and I think that's a great analogy.

If I think about VMware, they started in spring. Spring is when things are new, the little shoots are coming up, the landscape is blank. VMware's springtime was workstation, GSX, ESX—still kind of finding their footing. Remember the first time you heard about VMware? You thought, "It sounds crazy. There's no way I'd put a production workload on that." But after spring comes summer. Summer for VMware is when things are bold and strong. That's vSphere, vSAN, Horizon, Workspace One. Then comes fall—autumn—when you start collecting resources and bulking up. That's VMware Cloud, Carbon Black, Pivotal, Nyansa—lots of others because you need enough in the store for winter.

Winter is when you're owned by private equity, you re-evaluate everything, fire some customers, fire some employees, and make room for what's next. This isn't a bad thing, by the way. We need the cycle. We're all making room for what's next.

The same applies to Citrix—equally big part of my career as VMware. We had WinFrame, MetaFrame, Xenapp in the springtime. That was all new—we couldn't believe it. Citrix bought XenSource, cloud.com, ShareFile, Podio—all these things to bulk up for winter. Their winter now is owned by private equity, re-evaluate everything, fire some customers, fire some employees, and make room for what's next. Again, this isn't bad. This is the cycle.

At the end of winter comes spring, and you need to have room for what's next or else it can't flourish. The little green shoots only get sunlight because everything on top of them—the leaves have fallen off—has been cleared out for winter.

This doesn't just apply to companies. It applies to me, you, each of us personally. I think about the seasons of my career. I began 30 years ago in Akron, Ohio, working for VARs—value-added resellers—learning and figuring things out. When I left to do my own thing with brianmadden.com, that was my summer. BriForum, books, training, learning how to give presentations. Autumn for me was the VMware CTO office. That's where you take everything you worked so hard for in summer and harvest it. I'd been a commentator in the industry, an analyst, a consultant, a speaker. Now it's time to do something different—build some products. Winter for me was the pinball company, which isn't a knock on pinball. Winter was backing away from what I was doing in technology, hunkering down, learning new technologies. I worked with GitHub, learned about GitHub Autopilot, did coding, and refreshed myself. Like healing—all the things we do in winter. And then I had the cycle, and of course I needed winter so that I could have spring again.

This applies to individual pieces of your career and even individual technologies. Think about how seasons work for any of us—whether it's our career, a company, or a specific technology we're interested in. Spring is about learning and exploration. Spring is experimentation. There are new tools, new technologies, new concepts. Everything is fun and new and bright. Nothing really matters because if four of the seeds die, there's four more over here. You're trying to figure it out, starting to build a foundation, understanding the principles of the technologies you're working with. It's where we make our initial mistakes. We all have to be able to make mistakes and learn our lessons.

Summer is when you start really implementing the knowledge you learned in spring. You grow and expand. You start collaborating. Remember the first time you posted in a forum, responded to an email, stood on stage? It felt pretty good. You might not do that in spring because you're just learning. In summer, you start to share a little bit, and it feels good. You're expanding, growing, meeting peers, going to VMUGs and shaking hands, seeing the same people year after year. That's when you gain confidence and visibility—not necessarily on the global stage, but maybe within your company, your friends, your peer groups. People start to say, "This guy actually knows some things."

Autumn is about reaping the benefits—harvest time. You start leading major initiatives, major projects. You start mentoring people, really sharing the knowledge you built up in summer. You refine all the processes and methods you've been learning. You get recognized as an expert—doesn't have to be on the global stage, could be within your department, your company, your friends. Autumn is when you really benefit from all the work you've been doing.

Then comes winter—reflection. You reflect on your achievements, on what's phasing out, what hasn't been relevant anymore. You plan for the future. The new year starts in winter for a reason. You plan for what's next, let go of outdated technologies and practices, and make space for growth and innovation. Then of course that leads us back into spring.

If I take a technology like Citrix, I can say it goes through its spring phase, summer phase, autumn phase, and winter phase—but that might not be the same phase as the company. These are your phases and what they mean to you. And it's also happening with multiple technologies at once—Citrix, VMware, maybe cloud, maybe Kubernetes. I don't read too much into the words. I'm just saying we all have different technologies in different seasons. While you're learning on one, it's summer. On another, you're harvesting. This one's dead, so you're making space. It continues again and again, and this happens with all of us.

Looking at my career over 30 years from 1994 to 2024—I began on the help desk with PC Tech and Novell NetWare. Then desktop engineering, SMS, SCCM, Citrix, ASPs, blades, VMware, VDI, HCI, MDM, MAM, EMM, consumerization of IT, digital workspace, future of work. Thirty years—you can cram a lot in there. Every single one of these, I was really into it. I read the books, went to the conferences, was in the newsgroups and email lists. I was all in on every single one of these. I'm not into all of them anymore. Some have longer cycles, some shorter, some have subcycles within them. They're all different, but I can look at this and see the things I've done and the cycles they've had.

But for me, I'm trying to figure out what's next. My winter was pinball time to figure out what's next. And now I'm back in the enterprise tech world after a couple years in winter. What is it? What's next? Well, I look at this and I'm like, where is this going and what could it possibly be? I think I got it. I've been doing some reading. I understand this is going to be a thing. I feel good, great, wonderful—I know what's next. I know where to focus my efforts. And here we are.

It's good, it's fantastic because I know AI. I mean, I've been doing AI since—well, actually, I've been doing AI since 2023. It's funny because you hear all these people saying, "Oh, I've been doing AI for 10 years, 20 years, 30 years." I've been doing AI for 10 minutes. If you look at my life from 1977 to 2024, the percentage of my life pre- and post-AI is about here, give or take. I understand what AI was before, thank you. I saw 2001, Terminator, Her. Computers too confusing for humans, killer robots, sex bots—tell me what else I need to know about AI. Of course, over time we got co-pilots, ChatGPT was released in 2022. I didn't use it for the first few months, but by 2023 I was playing with ChatGPT and thought, "Ah, I get this. This is clearly the future." So I know some things about AI.

The problem is my modern, present-day AI knowledge is this tiny little sliver. I'm with all these people who've been doing AI for 10 years, 20 years, training models, tuning, doing RAG something-or-other, merging models. They've got GitHub accounts, doing all these things, and I'm like, "Yeah, I'm good at ChatGPT. I can use it." It's scary to me, and I feel like I don't know what to do. But I think it's okay because it's springtime for AI.

Not just for me, but for the technology cycle—the macro cycle for AI in the enterprise context is spring. Even though it's spring and we're all learning and figuring things out, I already feel behind again. But I've done this before. I learned like 20, 30 new things in my career. I know what to do. I'll just run the same playbook I've done for the past 30 years when I learned new technologies.

Off to the internet I go. I get my glasses out because that's how I roll now. "Artificial intelligence"—and there are 1.4 million billion trillion results. That's generic. Let me do "artificial intelligence learning"—and there are somehow even more. The AI content exponentially increased between my two searches. There are literally 200 million more resources in the 30 seconds it took me to collect my thoughts. It's fine though. Google searches are tough now with SEO everywhere. I'll just buy a book. I wrote books, you all wrote books—that's how we learn. You have to be smart to write a book. I go to Amazon, type in "artificial intelligence," and there are 50,000 books. All right, it's tough.

How do you jump on this? I feel like the train left and I'm just standing on the platform holding my bag. Okay, if I can take a breath and collect myself, what do we know? Let's break this down. What do we actually know about what to do next and how to address these technologies?

We know how to learn. We've done this before. We're VMware experts, cloud experts, Microsoft experts. We learned from nothing, and we learned. Okay, we know how to learn. We have to set a goal. Everything needs a goal. I spent years as a consultant—you set a goal and work backwards. My goal is to be an AI expert because that's what's next. But here I start coming across all these quotes about panic attacks—what in the world do I do with this? How do I even understand what's happening? As I'm worried about the train leaving without me, you know how in French you say you're learning something? It literally tells you that you need to be on the train, which I've already established I'm not on. It's a panic attack. What am I doing?

Okay, what do we know? You can't become an AI expert. That's not a thing. It's too big, too much. This is different than our old journeys. But it's spring for AI. The stakes are low. Now's the time to play. Springtime is about learning, exploration, experimentation, new tools, new technologies, building the foundation, understanding principles. We can make mistakes. We'll learn things. It's okay to mess up at this point, which is nice because honestly, as I play more with AI—and I've been doing this for like a year—what you focus on actually doesn't matter. That's a good thing.

Do you remember how prompt engineering was going to be all the rage? Job postings for prompt engineers everywhere. Prompt engineering went from the hottest new tech job to obsolete in six months. The AI auto-fixes its prompts based on what you type. It figures out what you might want, and you don't have to be a prompt engineer anymore. There are countless stories of this. A company spent $10 million training ChatGPT on their own data, only to find when GPT-4 was released it outperformed it right out of the box. Oops. That's an expensive lesson. But the point is—it's not like you're behind. What model, what do I do? What do I need to understand? It's changing so fast. That's the thing we really know right now. It's changing so fast.

So we have to take a step back. What's our goal? Is it to figure out how our company can use AI, think about where things are going and how that affects the company? Is our goal to figure out how we can use AI to improve ourselves and what we're doing? Or is our goal to upskill ourselves for future employability if white-collar jobs are at risk? That's what I do. My personal goal is—what will work look like in five or ten years, and how do I make sure I can provide value in a way that fits in?

Any one of these goals is fine. They're not even mutually exclusive. But I think what's important is that we figure out what our goal is before we start playing with different things. And regardless of the goal, we have to remember—we're not going to become experts. This is not how it was with VMware, Citrix, or Microsoft back then. We could get the book, read all the instruction manuals, do a couple big projects, and be legitimately an expert on Horizon after a few years. You'd know all the underlying technologies. That's not a thing that exists in AI.

The first thing we have to do is change our mindset. But it's okay because we don't have to know how something works in order to know it's valuable. Airplanes—I don't know how they work. Apparently mechanics don't either sometimes. We don't have to know how it works to know it's valuable, right? We don't have to know how something works to know how to use it. I'm good at a lot of things I can do that I don't actually know how they work. That's different from what we've been doing in the past. It's different than how other technologies have worked.

There's that quote about the easiest way to predict the future is to invent it—but that's malarkey. Inventing the future is very difficult. Luckily, the easiest way to predict the future is to think about what assumptions will be true. We know models will get better. We know how capitalism works, how different systems fit together, how human nature works, how companies work. We can think about those and apply them to the future and work backwards.

Today, the hype around AI follows the same playbook that hype around any technology follows. I spent a lot of time at brianmadden.com demystifying what vendors are doing. That's what's happening now—vendor shenanigans are maxed out in the AI world. We're fully in the peak of inflated expectations. This plays into the feeling that we're all being left behind because we see all the things Microsoft is doing, all the things vendors are doing, all the things companies are doing. Everything's on Hugging Face, and you go there and think, "What is this?" Everything's faster, next, next, next. But I'm telling you—it's hype. AI is real, the technology is real, but the hype is 100 times what the reality is.

We're not as far behind as we thought because a lot of things we're seeing are nonsense. That's good because we've been dealing with vendor nonsense our whole careers. We have maximalist awesomeness from vendor slides right now. You see vendors talking about amazing things that are exactly what you want, and then you think about it and realize—this is nonsense. I've been to real AI shows and blacked out the vendor logos. Two different conferences, and the slides with the most arms up taking photos said things like "Real world data is power. Don't trust the tech—it's mind-blowing but not limitless. It'll create value, not everywhere. Costs come rapidly if you don't pay attention." This is all true, but it applies to cloud, Microsoft licensing, literally everything in the business world we've been applying. The number of arms up taking pictures? Nonsense.

I've started writing about this on LinkedIn—I guess I'm blogging now. I've been to these conferences, and you come out thinking you're so far behind. But as we process more, we're not as behind as we thought. It's springtime for all these vendors too. They don't know what they're doing—in a good way. They're experimenting, figuring out what sticks, what they can do, how to make the message. Everyone is figuring this out at the same time. There are lots of individual wins, but largely there's a lot of nonsense.

Even now, in the past few weeks, we're seeing more articles about people dialing back expectations about what things can do. Even co-pilots are starting to say, "Don't use this for this use case, be careful about that use case. Remember, it's an LLM—it's just statistics and might not be the same." We're seeing rollbacks of expectations. This is the vendor hype cycle—you hit the peak of inflated expectations, then you get to the trough of disillusionment. That's where we are. Virtualization had this, cloud had this, Citrix had this, VDI had this. Every technology on that 30-year cycle had this. This isn't bad. This isn't saying AI isn't good for things. It's saying where we are right now, we have time. We're not as behind as we might have thought just because we haven't built a model on our own laptops.

This is really funny because what we know is this is the first time in history that no one has any idea what the world will look like in 20 years. Yuval Noah Harari wrote that. He's the author of "Sapiens." He said this on the Colbert show a few weeks ago. Humanity doesn't know, and regarding virtualization and cloud and this kind of thing—we don't know what the world will look like in the next 20 years. We don't have any understanding. Does capitalism exist? Does business exist? Are we all on universal basic income? Do different countries handle this differently? There are a lot of moving pieces, so we don't know, which allows us to take a step back, catch our breath, and say it's okay if we don't fully understand where things are going.

For me, this is an opportunity. Things are definitely different this time. We know AI is bigger change than virtualization or cloud or any specific technology. It affects everything—not just in the tech world but in all of society. This isn't like the old days where you read about a new technology, buy a book, attend a conference, and know everything you need to know. Now it's still the wild, wacky creation, figuring things out. Things are changing faster than we can learn them no matter what you figure out, no matter what model you download. Remember when it was a big deal to figure out what model you needed? Well, now you can merge models together and create new ones. It's very dynamic and interesting, but it's a big change.

The vendors, solutions, techniques, even the limitations of what we have today won't be the same in six months. But that's okay. It's still spring. It's still AI spring. Now's our chance for not knowing what we're doing. Now's our chance for vendors not to know. We give the vendors a pass, they give us a pass, we give each other a pass. We're figuring out what's happening as we go along.

There's this old adage: no one ever got fired for buying IBM. Just do what everyone did before you. We said about VMware: no one ever got fired for buying VMware. Did anyone ever get fired for doing nothing? It's a weird time when companies are building their AI strategy around actually waiting to see how things shake out. Not everyone's doing that, and that's valid for some, valid for others. But there's time. The fear to jump in, to establish something, to make big moves right now—we can wait a little bit.

Going back at consumerization of IT—I spent a lot of work on this maybe 10, 15 years ago where users could do whatever they wanted. What do we know right now? AI is the ultimate consumerization of IT. Every company is an early adopter of AI, even if they're not doing it at the company level. Their employees are doing it. A lot of companies are leading edge and experimenting and competing with and getting AI advantage without their knowledge. There's a great article about detecting the secret cyborgs because in some ways that's what AI is—you're human-machine augmented, especially if you're a knowledge worker, if that's what you exchange for money.

Machines are helping you. LLMs make terrible software today—it's statistical rather than procedural, and things are sometimes weird. We're working on that, they're working on that, I'm not working on it. But they're awesome for individual productivity. Every study, and yourself if you use GPT—I pay for three different GPT services now, $20 a month each. I couldn't even guess how many times a day—50 times a day all of them. They help in all these little ways. We understand how hallucination works. We understand what you can ask, what you have to check, where you can trust it, where you don't. It's just like our relationship with a coworker.

We know LLMs can be great for our own productivity. We also know that if we ignore this—are our coworkers ignoring this? Are our competitors ignoring this?—so for us, it's the ultimate reflection of IT not really being in control of what their users are able to do. The company's not really able to be in control. We're trying to understand that, but we're still trying to understand and figure out and play with things.

A lot of this stuff I got from a website I love for AI thought leadership called Synthetic Work. If you don't know this website, you know the guy Alessandro Perilli who did VirtualizationReview, right? That dude's been doing AI for like 20 years. He was at Red Hat before this. His website as far as resources is fantastic. His newsletters are once a week, 20 pages—my mind is blown every single one. I have a few other resources I like. Alessandro Perilli for synthetic.work, I really love Daniel Miessler at danielmiessler.com, and I love Ethan Mollick at One Useful Thing. And of course, I love talking to actual real humans and things like these VMUGs.

For me, as we're taking our first steps, it's like the baby deer just starting to stumble and walk. As we take our first steps, we start to understand what things can do, where to look. We need guidance, and these are some of the resources including everyone here in this room that I've been looking at.

Before I leave you with my final thoughts, I want to make one program note. I'm coming to the Netherlands right before Kings Day. I'm still doing a lot of EUC work. There's a two-day training class I'm teaching on digital workplace—my 30 years of EUC knowledge crammed into two days—and I'll be doing it in Utrecht next month.

But the final thing I want to leave you all with is we have to just start playing and not be afraid. It's springtime. Let's do it. For me, what am I playing with? This thing called Open Interpreter. Have you heard of Open Interpreter? This project began last year. Open Interpreter lets LLMs run code on your computer to complete tasks. It's an LLM interface to your desktop, and it can see your screen. You can interact with it completely. It's open source and free. They have this thing called the O1 Computer that you build on an ESP32. They have the code, the hardware files, HDL files—everything where you can talk to it. You can say, "Open this email, go to this task, open this, look at that email." It's actually watching and screen-scraping your desktop, but it can do things on its own. It's a full interface.

You can run your own LLM on it, or use OpenAI or other ones that exist. What's interesting is it runs on your desktop, so you can go out in the world and talk to this little device. There's also an iPhone app, but your desktop has to run in the background. You have to keep your desktop on, have your computer running. But the desktop is the ultimate aggregation point of all your applications and files. So I have to keep a desktop running in the cloud that I can then access from anywhere.

Keep a desktop running in the cloud that I can access from anywhere? In other words—could it be? Is it finally true? Did we get there? Is that what it took? AI finally means this can be the year of the desktop. Wow, we made it. There's a purpose—it's the cloud, it's fantastic.

I'm so excited about it. I'm going to be playing with this next week, and I hope you all play with it too. I really, really thank you for the opportunity to speak with you all today. Thank you.
