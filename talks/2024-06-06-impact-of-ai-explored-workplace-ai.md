# Impact of AI: Explored - June 6, 2024

## Episode details

**Title:** Microsoft Recall: A New Era for Workplace AI

**Context:** Brian's first appearance on the Impact of AI: Explored podcast. At this point he was an independent consultant focused on workplace AI, just before joining Citrix. The episode covers the GPT-4o release, Microsoft Recall, and a wide-ranging conversation about how AI will reshape the workplace.

**Key arguments made:**
- Coined and explained the term "workplace AI" as a distinct category from consumer AI, AI science, and operational AI
- AI screen recording combined with VDI/DaaS desktops creates the ultimate secure compliance machine
- Productivity measurement becomes fundamentally harder with AI because the valuable work (knowing where to kick the mainframe) is invisible
- Companies have a fiduciary duty to adopt AI productivity tools, creating inevitable pressure toward workplace monitoring
- Even if all AI progress stopped today, existing technology can fundamentally change how organizations operate
- Current AI use is "faster horses"—text generation and summarization rather than rethinking work itself
- The real conversation about workplace AI impact isn't happening; it's all platitudes about "doing good strategies"
- Shadow AI parallels the consumerization of IT, but the stakes are higher because it's "shadow strategy" not just shadow tools
- VDI is having a resurgence because the serialized pixel stream is the perfect interception point for AI compliance

> **Note:** This is a condensed transcript highlighting Brian's key arguments, not a verbatim word-for-word record. The full episode is ~60 minutes of conversation. Refer to the [original video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzBnEPTgH2A) for the complete discussion.

Hi everyone, and welcome to our podcast series, the Impact of AI Explored, where we look at AI from the user point of view. I'm joined by my co-host James. James, how are you doing?

I'm doing well.

Nice man. And we have a guest, a famous EUC rockstar. Brian, welcome man.

Bonjour. Hi, I'm Brian Madden. I live in Paris now. I've been in IT for 30 years, mostly in the end-user computing side of things. So you may know me from brianmadden.com or BriForum or the books. And I do a lot with like Citrix and VMware. More recently, especially since the pandemic, I've gotten involved in not just EUC but like future of work, digital workplace. And now I'm actually focused on what I'm calling workplace AI. So it's sort of a continuation of all the digital workplace, how employees use technology, and it's looking at how AI is going to make all that really, really complicated.

Good to see you. Nice to have you. We're going to have a really cool talk about the things that Microsoft is doing and your vision about AI in the workplace. But first, of course, as always, we're going to start with the news. And it's been a busy week in AI land, or busy month in AI land. The big two things in our point of view were the release of GPT-4o. So that's a really cool model. And the second thing was Microsoft Recall.

I believe it was at Microsoft Build where they announced it, and it seems like a very very interesting but scary technology. So Brian, your thoughts on Microsoft Recall?

Yeah, so Microsoft Recall, the idea is that your Windows computer would essentially take a screenshot every few seconds, then use AI to analyze those screenshots. So it creates this searchable index of everything you've ever done on your computer. And the idea is you could say, "Hey, what was that website I was looking at last Tuesday?" or "What was that email about?" And it would find it because it's been recording everything.

Now, the privacy implications are enormous. I mean, think about it from a corporate standpoint. If I'm running VDI desktops and I have this capability built in, I can now have an AI-powered compliance engine that watches every screen of every employee. If personally identifiable information pops up, it gets blurred. If someone's in a location that's not secure, certain data gets masked. The technology exists today to do this.

And here's the thing people don't want to hear: if I'm a business owner and I think I can use AI capabilities to record all my employees' screens and have that go up to some analysis engine, and I can make myself three times more productive—whether that's three times more revenue, three times faster to market, or the same work with one-third the employees—I have a fiduciary responsibility to my shareholders to maximize return on capital. If this technology exists and I'm not using it, that's a dereliction of duty.

People say employees are going to quit. I say, if I can triple your productivity, I'll double your salary. You're telling me you're not going to find a lot of employees who'll take that deal? Here's the deal: we're going to give you a work laptop, a work tablet, a work phone. Everything you do on this is going to be recorded. It's going to be tracked. It's going to be used with AI. And we're going to use it to make our entire company a massive superbrain. Now that sounds scary. Do not do anything personal on your work devices unless you want it in the forever record. But hey, we're going to pay you double literally what you're making right now.

I bet there's a stack of resumes taller than this room for people who'd want to sign up for that.

But here's the productivity measurement problem. You know that old joke about the mainframe that was down, costing the company $10 million a day? The owner says he'll pay anyone a million dollars to fix it. A guy comes in, looks around, kicks it, and it starts working. He sends a bill for a million dollars. The owner says, "A million dollars for kicking the mainframe?" The guy sends a new bill: "Kicking the mainframe: $10. Knowing where to kick the mainframe: $999,990."

The danger with AI is it only has access to the part of our humanness that interacts with computers. It's going to be very difficult for companies to resist the urge to take screen captures and outputs and start to stack rank employees and figure out who's actually "productive." But sometimes you go for a walk and that thing you've been trying to figure out clicks—and then you type an email that took one minute to write. The typing took one minute, but it took you a hundred minutes to know what to type. How do you measure and quantify that?

And this is not just about monitoring. Think about what happens to the concept of work itself. If text output generation has zero marginal cost, what am I doing all day? Am I working half the time for the same money? Am I working half the time for half the amount? Are they going to lay off half the people? Maybe it's not a mass firing; maybe people randomly quit and they just don't hire replacements. And who gets screwed is the young college kids coming up.

My belief is no one is really talking about the real workplace AI impact and issues. It's all platitudes. "AI is going to change things." And then the last sentence is always, "So that's why it's important to do good strategies and make sure you do it right." I'm like, what? That's not actionable. What do I do with that?

So everything I'm working on now is organizing and constructing all my thoughts—the way I did with the VDI books and the DaaS books—into a guide about the real conversation about what's really going on. What's legit, what's not legit, what are the real issues, and what can you actually think about now?

Even if all AI evolution stops today, everything that exists as products today can really fundamentally change how organizations operate, the relationships with their employees, how they pay them, what they pay them for. There's so much that goes into this that people are just not thinking about today.
