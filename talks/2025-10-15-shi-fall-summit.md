## Transcript

Hello. Thank you for that introduction. My name is Brian Madden and I'm a futurist at Citrix. I've been in the IT industry for 31 years, and I concur with that statement about how the next five years are going to be bigger transformation in the way we work, the way we deliver applications, data, and computing to our workers—certainly bigger than anything I've seen in my entire career.

I'm going to focus on the next 12-month window because a lot of presentations talk about AI in really futuristic terms—10 years out, 5 years out, which is fun or maybe scary to think about. But I think what's more practical is: what does this mean for my job today? What do I actually need to know? What do I need to do this month, next month, through 2026? So I'm mostly going to focus on the next 12 to 18 months.

Most IT AI projects fall into two categories. They're either horizontal—across the whole organization—but very shallow. These are chatbots and copilots, things you deploy to everybody saying "good luck figuring out how it works." The other type is vertical and deep—line of business specific systems where you take one area of your business and completely redo it with AI.

The problem with these is that a lot of big transformational IT projects go over budget, take a lot of time, are expensive, and don't meet expectations. But I think the real action and the real place where all the activity is happening in the enterprise is down in user land—what your actual workers are bringing and doing on their own.

Workers are finding tools on their own. They're using ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Grok, whatever tools they find. And if you ask them, AI really is transforming their jobs. For a lot of these folks, ChatGPT or Claude or Gemini is their primary interface into the work they do. They're going there first before they think about going to applications or whatever portal the company has set up.

How individual workers are using these tools has changed over time. Initially they used them just for chat—asking questions, getting back answers. But as ChatGPT's capabilities improved and our own ability to use them got better, we realized we can use them for brainstorming. As they got bigger context windows, we can use them to analyze information like huge PDFs and reports, and actually have conversations about the data. We can use them to create not just PowerPoints and documents and emails, but strategies and business advice.

ChatGPT came out in November 2022—less than three years ago—but over those past three years quite a few changes have been made and it's gotten a lot deeper and better. Now we're finding what I call full-on shadow strategy.

You've heard the term shadow IT and shadow AI. A lot of people say individual workers bring in their own AI tools—that's shadow AI. But I think it's really selling short what the actual impact is. When shadow IT first happened, it was using Gmail to get around attachment limits in the early 2000s, bringing in iPhones to replace Blackberries, using Dropbox instead of file shares with VPNs. Workers were bringing in tools because these tools did more. But this isn't about tools anymore. Yes, ChatGPT is a tool, but we're actually brainstorming strategy, calling all the stuff we would do with our human co-workers—we're now doing with ChatGPT. So calling it shadow AI isn't giving enough gravity for what the impact actually is. It's full-on shadow strategy.

What we've seen is AI has grown from being a subtle helper—"Oh, help me write this email. What should I say to my boss?"—and it's evolving into a full-blown colleague. This transition is very subtle because from the outside, you don't see it. Workers are still using ChatGPT, just like in 2023, and they're still using it now. But the way we're using ChatGPT is changing—the questions we're asking, how much we're leaning on it, where we go first by default.

What's interesting is even though ChatGPT has all these capabilities within the chat, capabilities are breaking out of the chat window. This summer was the summer of AI browser wars. There are all these new browsers like Comet and DIA. There's also old browsers like Chrome now with Gemini bolted onto the side, and Edge now with Copilot bolted onto the side. You can't have just a browser anymore—your browser needs to have a built-in AI buddy attached to it. The idea is: I'm using a browser, I'm using AI, I'm using browser, I'm using AI. Half the time I'm copying and pasting back and forth. Can't the AI just look at the browser content and know what I'm doing, figure it out, maybe offer helpful tips and hints, and just pay attention to everything I see so I can ask you later about something I saw? There's a lot of value in integrating the AI platform and the browser more directly.

Every browser has AI built-in today. This isn't coming—this happened in the past 3 to 6 months. You might have to pay 10 bucks a month for Gemini add-on to Chrome or whatever, but it exists.

These AI platforms are much more than just chatbots now. You can't really think of it as just a chatbot. Look at Claude as an example—here are all these connectors built into Claude. There's a scroll bar showing Claude now has connectors to Google Docs, OneDrive, your calendar, Salesforce, SaaS tools—all these things. If I plug it into Google Drive, I can ask Claude: "Hey, what's my presentation? How many slides is it? Can you look at this slide? Send this over here?" You can start asking it about your documents and files or your calendar without having to copy and paste, because in the old days you were screenshotting or copying and pasting everything. Now Claude can access these things directly.

Claude can also access applications on your desktop directly. It can access your notes files, your Word documents, your calendar, your terminal. It can run PowerShell and run scripts locally on your computer, so it can do things that don't have backend connectors. You can also make your own connectors—MCP servers are a way to put a computer interface onto a service for AI. Any connector Claude doesn't have in the box, you can plug in any random MCP server in the world. The infrastructure for connecting these AIs into applications is being built out right now. Not just Claude—ChatGPT has apps and was announced to be added into ChatGPT a few weeks ago. This is happening in all the platforms.

These things are so much more than just chatbots. In fact, I don't even want to call them chatbots. I don't know if I want to call them large language models. What do we call them instead? There's a lot of proposals out there. Are they AI productivity platforms? Agent platforms? AIOS? Oh my god, I can't even say that out loud. That's a real term though that people are using—"these are AIOS." I'm like, please no. I'm sure that's probably what it's going to be called.

Whatever these things are, the bottom line is these tools are becoming the gateway to work for human knowledge workers. This is one of the big things I want you all to take away from this—it's not just another application. It's not like I use Word and Browser and PowerPoint and Excel and Claude. It's like: I use Claude, and I only drop down into the applications if Claude can't do what I want to do or ChatGPT or Copilot or whatever. Claude's my buddy, and I'm going there for everything, and then it's going to access these other things kind of behind the scenes because Claude connects to these services. Workers are talking to the AI platforms, and the AI platform is going to connect back into Google or Microsoft or whatever business apps I need, and it kind of does it on its own. I don't even need to ask. I can ask it a question about a file, and it should figure out: "Oh, I need to check his calendar because he's asking a question about a calendar and I see his calendar's connected. Let me check. He probably wants me to do that."

What about old applications that don't have these connectors? Well, this summer ChatGPT announced agent bridging research and action. It's like when you tell your parents, "Just don't touch the mouse. Let me do it for you." Now the chatbots can actually drive your browser for you. Any applications that don't have these modern interfaces—no problem. If it's a website, your old Oracle financials expense system or travel system that's crazy to use, you set the robot on it and the robot can go all day, scroll through 10 million cities to find the one you're trying to go to, and do your expense reports for you. AI platforms now have the ability to actually operate browsers for us.

So workers are talking to AI platforms. AI platforms are talking to new apps. AI platforms are controlling web applications. That's awesome. What about applications that don't have connectors or web interfaces—like all your old desktop applications? There's still a time when we need to use a desktop computer, whether it's for old applications or workflows that require that interactivity. So how does AI deal with that?

There's a thing called computer-using agents. All the AI vendors do these now. Anthropic has Claude computer use. Microsoft has a whole bunch of different ones. OpenAI has computer-using agents. This is where the actual AI can literally use your computer the same way a human does. It can operate the mouse, look at the screen, move the mouse, click around.

There's a benchmark called OSWorld—an open-source benchmark with 360 tasks in a desktop environment. It's got English language instructions like: "Take this file, open it, edit this, send it to Bob, change the background color, update the time zone, change this over here, move this." Just a whole bunch of tasks written in English. When the benchmark runs through it, you either get a yes or a no.

This came out in April 2024—18 months ago. Humans can do 72% of these tasks. In April 2024, the AI robots could do 12%. That's 18 months ago. By August, we got up to 61%. Not bad. (laughter) It's October now and they're up to 70%. I'm going to call that a rounding error—close enough.

What this basically means is humans' ability to operate a computer is not that much better or different than an AI's ability to operate a computer. That doesn't mean the AI knows how to do everything—it's like a junior employee you have. You can tell them what to do on the computer, they might not know why they're doing it because you're explaining it to them, but they know how to move a mouse, click here, email this. Occasionally they mess up. Occasionally AI messes up. It's all the same. But it is real today—all these platforms have the capability to actually operate a computer environment as AI, move files around, do everything a human would do. What permissions does it have? What guardrails? It's all what you provide. You manage it the same way you manage a person.

So my workers are accessing my AI platforms. Those AI platforms are connecting to modern apps. Those AI platforms are connecting via web browsers if it's not a modern app. If it's not a web browser and needs to operate a computer, it will be a computer-using agent.

The way workers interact with these AI platforms is changing too. It was chat—just typing before. Now it's voice. I do voice almost exclusively. My wife can't stand this. She's like, "You're talking to AI, you're talking to me." And apparently I have an AI voice that's extra enunciated. But I talk to chat all the time because I can just brain dump faster into it. Of course, these things aren't interacting just with talking and typing. They're looking at our screens, generating videos, generating images. There's a lot of different ways we interact with them—visualizing data, if the AI is editing an Excel file for me, it can just show me the cells I care about. It doesn't need to open Excel; it can just draw a picture for me of the data I need. There's a lot of different ways we're able to interact with these.

Same with applications—it's not just a phone app, web app, or desktop app. They're all in sync. You can start a conversation on your phone, pick it up on your desktop, talk to it on earbuds on a walk, and then pick it up on your iPad when you get home. There's multiple different ways we're all interacting with these.

What's funny though is something else, and this is a blog post I did just yesterday. A few weeks ago, Claude can now create and edit files directly. Remember I thought computer-using agents were important because you might need Excel, you might need to do something in Excel, so the AI would need to open Excel, load in your Excel file, and click around through the menus. It turns out that Excel files are just XML open data formats, and AI is really smart. So now the AI doesn't even need Excel. You tell me what you want out of that file—what data, what you want me to do with it, you want to change the rows, the formatting, you want to make a report, add charts. Yeah, I can do that. But it's actually editing the Excel file directly—like CRISPR gene editing. It's no longer opening Excel and navigating through that.

This also applies to Word, PowerPoint, PDFs, code you're writing. In a lot of cases, the real value of an application was just having capabilities and then having a user interface humans could understand. Well, if AI has its own capabilities, it doesn't need the user interface. So I don't even know if AI needs these desktop applications anymore. I'm calling this the post-application realization, and there's a four-step process I went through.

Stage one: we need Excel because it's important. I've been saying that for 31 years. I work at Citrix. We can help you deliver Excel to any device, any time, whatever. But we need Excel because Excel is important. So for me, hey, what does that world view mean in the land of artificial intelligence? The artificial intelligence will just operate Excel for us because we need Excel. But then I'm like, wait—this is last week—wait, why does the AI need Excel exactly if it can manipulate these Excel files directly? Well, what if I have to see something visually? The AI can draw things. If the AI can draw Superman and the Pope in a puppy coat, it can sure draw a chart (laughter) of your spreadsheet data. No problem. So why do I need Excel? And that means do I need any of these apps or do I just need access to their file formats or the data formats or whatever's in the back end?

Applications—the way we manage applications—are like how we manage data. The data is still important. I still have permissions. I still want audits. I still want DLP, but that's kind of wrapping around the data. That's not a feature of the application per se. So I can get that without having these applications.

Think about how this fits into this overall picture. My AI platform is doing modern apps via connectors. It's doing web apps by controlling a web browser. It's doing desktop applications by driving a desktop. And now I can add—or it's like skipping the apps and manipulating the files or data directly.

What's interesting is the evolution is the same way ChatGPT evolved for us. When you first used ChatGPT, that was cool—you had it write some dirty lyrics, write poetry with no letter E, little party tricks. But you didn't use it for anything real. Over time, you started to use it more and more for real things. Then you just realize: oh wow, I don't Google things anymore. I just ask ChatGPT. I think that happens with this too. I don't think anyone is going to consciously say "I will never use Excel again," but how long is it going to be now? "Oh, I've got Copilot and I've got OneDrive and it's all here and a little copilot thing is right there and I can just ask it a question about a file and it just tells me the answer and I didn't have to open Excel and do it."

That's the baby step that's going to happen bit by bit by bit. Then I'm going to start creating automations where I say, "Hey, every morning look at this spreadsheet or look at this data wherever this data lives and build me a spreadsheet and then email it to these people." And now that happens and I'm not doing it anymore. By the way, is that an application I just created? Yes. Do I manage that application? Well, it has permissions, it has files, it operates, it does a lot of things. Of course, in the old days, applications were important. We spent money on applications, bought licenses, paid for support, had to approve applications, test them, make sure they're good, do security audits.

Well, if anyone can create an application just by asking an AI to do something, and that application might be long, might be written in who knows what code, might be one-and-done and gone in 15 seconds, you have to really change your mentality of how you're managing. You can't manage applications the old way. You need to take a step back and think about how you manage the environment in general, not the specific elements of that environment. Because as we're seeing, these AIs go from subtle helpers to colleagues to now full-on agents.

An agent—there's all different definitions for what an AI agent is. To me, this is just an AI environment that can run on its own and make decisions on its own. You just tell it to do something and it works all night, and if it gets in a roadblock, it figures out its way around it and off it goes. So the AI is kind of doing things on its own without the human worker having to look over it every single second.

What this means for us is that these are becoming like true co-workers. This is a slide I actually used from an internal QBR at Citrix where I introduce my team. Everyone else had their whole teams written out, and I was like: well, really I have chat and Claude and all these things that I really use in the way that a lot of people work with co-workers. So workers in the age of AI—the way that's happening—don't think about AI as an application. Think about it as an extension of a worker.

Every worker is going to bring their own AI. They're going to use it in their own way. I might like chat, maybe you like Claude. That's all fine. We'll use different AIs for different purposes. You really have to consider that your workers will have their own AIs, and the workers themselves are a combination of these AIs and the human workers.

The important thing for this is that which AI platforms you use and how you use them cannot come down from the top. If you say "we are going to use ChatGPT at our company, we just bought an enterprise license and everyone's using that," that's going to fail the same way as if you just say "corporate standard desktop—oh, here's one laptop, everyone gets the same laptop." Now, some companies have reasons to do that—maybe for security, purchasing, or other requirements—but a lot of companies embrace BYO. Yeah, there's standards. It has to meet these security standards. You have to put our agent on it, but you can use a Mac or Windows or I don't really care. I think the same thing is emerging in the AI space.

Individual workers are all going to use different platforms that they want to use themselves and use them for different reasons, for different things. A lot of individual workers might pay for them on their own. People are like, "What? I got to buy my own AI?" I'm like, "I don't know. You pay for your own iPhone. Maybe there's a stipend, whatever." Like, that's fine. Individual workers are going to bring the AI that they want.

Then as a company, we look at protecting our corporate assets collectively against all these agents coming in the same way we do with people. We have guardrails for people. We have audits, data loss prevention, we can record screens. All these things we can do to ensure humans are secure, we can also apply to these AIs.

Moving forward, our human workers are going to be using these AI platforms. These AI platforms then are connecting to the backend workspace where your applications are. Between the humans and the AIs, it's going to be whatever the human wants at that time. It might be a keyboard, mouse and monitor that they use it with. They might be video chatting with an AI avatar that's not even real—just like a colleague that is your AI. They might be using earbuds while they're mobile. They might be using whatever device you have. Your AI is in your head, but now I'm right here at the hotel and I just connect my phone to my screen and it's showing me the results of my spreadsheet or whatever. It will build on-demand the interfaces that you need.

The AI in the back end will talk via APIs, agent to agent, model context protocol. It'll operate web browsers remotely. It'll operate computer-using agents and remote sessions, or it might skip the app and manipulate the files directly. But it's going to be the workers going through. So what this means—in my last couple of seconds—what are we doing today in IT, specifically as we think about our users and our work? Today we manage workspaces which provide a secure space for workers to use apps and data. Today we provide guardrails that protect corporate data and we audit, observe, protect and guide. Tomorrow it's the same things—manage workspaces, provide guardrails, and observe, protect and guide.

My final slide—just going to leave you with some takeaways. AI platforms and agents are real. Everything I talked about today is real. This is not coming. This is real today. The path into the enterprise is going to be through the knowledge workers, bottom up, not top down. You do not need a full UI rebuild. You just need a well-designed UI system that is built for adaptability. Everything you're doing for human workers will also apply to AI workers.

The workspace will always exist as a point of orchestration, even if it's physical or virtual or invisible or ephemeral up in the cloud somewhere. Bottom line: this is happening whether you like it or not. By the way, you don't get a vote. You don't have to like it, but this is happening. You're not falling behind. Keep on doing what you're doing. And the final thing is: keep in touch for the latest.

These are kind of my takeaways. I blog about this stuff every week. You can follow me on LinkedIn. My blogs are on Citrix. I've got links to speeches and other stuff that you can find there. I write about this stuff every single week—not necessarily even from a Citrix perspective, just what it means for the future of the industry. Yeah, so that's it. I'm out of time. Thank you so much for giving me the opportunity to have 25 minutes like this. You're caught up on everything AI is different next week. Thank you.
