## Key themes across press commentary

Brian's interviews consistently return to:

- Workers adopt AI tools bottom-up, whether IT is ready or not
- The real security risk is AI acting at the worker's permission level, not classic data loss
- IT departments aren't set up to distinguish human actions from AI actions
- Every new tool (Cowork, OpenClaw, etc.) is another step toward the governance reckoning companies keep deferring
- "Boring infrastructure" (workspace governance, identity, policy enforcement) is the answer
