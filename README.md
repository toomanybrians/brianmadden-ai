# brianmadden.ai

Brian Madden's published thinking on AI and the future of knowledge work, structured as an expert knowledge module that any AI assistant can load and reason with.

## What is this?

brianmadden.ai isn't a website you read. It's a knowledge system designed for an AI to load on your behalf. Connect it to your AI, and it can draw on my frameworks, arguments, and current thinking during your normal conversations.

It's not a chatbot—chatbots are frozen in time. This updates as my thinking evolves, sometimes several times a day. And it's not a digital twin. It doesn't simulate me or pretend to be me. It's a living reference library that your AI draws from while you talk to it.

I recently wrote about building a [personal AI knowledge system](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/i-built-second-brain-using-ai-its-changed-way-work-future-madden-0tote/) and about why I think [experts should publish structured knowledge modules](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/hey-creators-stop-publishing-content-start-your-second-brian-madden-ca0ae) that people can plug into their own AI. brianmadden.ai is that idea, applied to my own work.

## How it works

brianmadden.ai has a custom MCP server. Add this as a connector in your AI tool's settings:

```
brianmadden.ai/mcp
```

Then just ask your AI about my published work, frameworks, or current thinking. Your AI synthesizes across the full connected body of work—not keyword searching, but reasoning with the architecture of the thinking.

Step-by-step instructions for Claude, ChatGPT, Copilot, Cursor, and others are at [brianmadden.ai/connect](https://brianmadden.ai/connect).

Once you're connected, try things like:
- "Apply Brian's invisible 80% framework to [your company/industry]"
- "What would Brian Madden think about [your AI strategy question]?"
- "What's Brian's current thinking on [enterprise AI, workspace governance, personal AI systems]?"
- "I'm preparing a presentation on the future of work. What's the most counterintuitive argument I should build around?"

## What's inside

- 30+ published [Citrix blog posts](https://www.citrix.com/blogs/?s=bmadden&type=author), LinkedIn articles & posts, speech transcripts, podcast transcripts, and interviews
- 9 standalone frameworks (invisible 80%, cognitive stack, post-application era, workspace-as-control-plane, and more)
- A 30,000-word synthesis distilling the intellectual foundation across all published work
- A "current thinking" file that captures where my head is right now—updated frequently
- AI loading instructions, knowledge hierarchy, and engagement rules
- A published [governance document](GOVERNANCE.md) that defines what goes in, what stays out, and how the publishing process works

Everything in brianmadden.ai is already public. The module adds structure and AI accessibility, not new content.

For the full file structure, loading order, and design principles, see [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md).

## About me

I'm Brian Madden, a technology officer and futurist at Citrix. I have 32 years in end-user computing and digital workplace. I've written 6 books, 2,000+ articles, and given over 1,000 talks globally. Originally from Ohio, I now live in Paris.

I explore how AI is reshaping knowledge work. My core thesis: the real AI transformation is happening worker-by-worker, not top-down. The invisible 80% of knowledge work—the judgment, reasoning, and tacit expertise that lives in workers' heads—is where the action is. Enterprise AI automates the scaffolding. A second brain amplifies the cognition.
