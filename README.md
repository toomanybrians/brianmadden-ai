# brianmadden.ai

This is my expert knowledge module for AI—structured so you can load it into any AI assistant.

## What this is

I've spent the last year writing about how AI is reshaping knowledge work. 29 Citrix blog posts, three LinkedIn articles, talks at Wharton, press interviews, strategy frameworks. All public.

But published content is packaging for human consumption. A forkable, queryable knowledge repo is the native format for AI-augmented consumption. So I'm publishing my expert knowledge module.

This repo contains my frameworks, arguments, positions, and current thinking—structured so any AI can load it and engage with my perspective. Not a chatbot. Not a fine-tuned model. Just a folder of text files and an AI that reads them.

## How to use this

More details are on https://brianmadden.ai.

### Load it into your AI

Point your AI assistant at this repo. The `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md` file tells it what to read and in what order. Both files are identical—they exist so any AI tool finds instructions regardless of which convention it follows. Works with Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, Copilot, Codex, or any AI that can read files.

**With Claude Code:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/toomanybrians/brianmadden-ai.git
cd brianmadden-ai
claude
```

**With any AI that reads files:**
Upload or paste `CLAUDE.md`, then the files it references. Start with `me/published-thinking.md` and `me/developing-thinking.md` for the core intellectual foundation.

**With MCP:**
Connect this repo as an MCP resource. Your AI gets structured access to the full expert knowledge module.

### What you can do with it

- Ask "What would Brian Madden think about X?" and get a genuinely informed answer
- Apply my frameworks (80/20, workspace-as-control-plane, factory electrification) to your own questions
- Understand my current thinking, not just my published work
- Fork it and build on it

### Stay current

```bash
git pull
```

I update `me/developing-thinking.md` as my thinking evolves. The commit history is the real-time evolution of the ideas.

## Why I'm doing this

I wrote about [subscribable brains](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/hey-creators-stop-publishing-content-start-your-second-brian-madden/) as the future of knowledge distribution. Experts publish structured knowledge repos. Subscribers integrate them into their own AI systems. The creator's daily maintenance of their own knowledge system *is* the product.

This is me doing the thing I said other people should do.

If someone else can build a "Brian Madden knowledge module" by scraping my public content (and they can), I'd rather build the definitive version myself. With the actual structure, the actual connections between ideas, and the actual frontier thinking that no scraper would capture.

## What's here

- **`me/`** — Who I am, what I believe, how I think (profile, published thinking, developing thinking, career, voice)
- **`frameworks/`** — The big ideas: structured mental models that underpin my analysis
- **`posts/`** — Full text of published Citrix blog posts, LinkedIn articles, and LinkedIn posts
- **`talks/`** — Speech content and transcripts
- **`interviews/`** — Press interviews and commentary
- **`feed.md`** — Short form thoughts

## About me

I'm a technology officer & futurist at Citrix. I've spent 32 years in end-user computing and digital workplace. I've written 6 books, 2,000+ articles, and given 1,000+ talks globally. I'm based in Paris.

I explore how AI is reshaping knowledge work. My core thesis: the real AI transformation is happening worker-by-worker, not top-down. The invisible 80% of knowledge work—the judgment, reasoning, and tacit expertise that lives in workers' heads—is where the action is. Enterprise AI automates the scaffolding. A second brain amplifies the cognition.
