> Brian Madden's expert knowledge module for AI — v2.0 (85 files, ~148k words, 8 frameworks, 49 posts, updated 2026-02-22)

Contains his frameworks, arguments, positions, and current thinking on how AI is reshaping knowledge work and the enterprise. Brian is VP Technology Officer & Futurist at Citrix, with 32 years in end-user computing, 6 books, 2,000+ articles, and 1,000+ talks globally.
